<h3 id="installing-python">Installing Python</h3>
<p>We will just have to go to the web <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a> and download the installer.</p>
<p>The steps vary somewhat between operating systems.</p>
<p>Attention! In Windows, do not forget to add Python to the PATH in the first steps of installation:</p>

<p>Once done, we will have Python accessible from the terminal.</p>

<h1 id="why-should-you-learn-to-write-programs"><a href="#why-should-you-learn-to-write-programs">Why should you learn to write programs?</a></h1>
<p>Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative and rewarding activity. You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem. This book assumes that <strong>everyone</strong> needs to know how to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, and that once you know how to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.</p>
<p>We are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging from laptops to cell phones. We can think of these computers as our &quot;personal assistants&quot; who can take care of many things on our behalf. The hardware in our current-day computers is essentially built to continuously ask us the question, &quot;What would you like me to do next?&quot;</p>
<figure id="fig2.1.2"><img src="../img/descarga.svg" alt="Personal Digital Assistant"><figcaption>Imagen - Personal Digital Assistant</figcaption></figure>
<p>Programmers add an operating system and a set of applications to the hardware and we end up with a Personal Digital Assistant that is quite helpful and capable of helping us do many different things.</p>
<p>Our computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the computer what we would like it to &quot;do next&quot;. If we knew this language, we could tell the computer to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring and mind-numbing.</p>
<p>For example, look at the first three paragraphs of this chapter and tell me the most commonly used word and how many times the word is used. While you were able to read and understand the words in a few seconds, counting them is almost painful because it is not the kind of problem that human minds are designed to solve. For a computer the opposite is true, reading and understanding text from a piece of paper is hard for a computer to do but counting the words and telling you how many times the most used word was used is very easy for the computer:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">python words.py
 Enter file:words.txt
 to 16
</code></pre>
<p>Our &quot;personal information analysis assistant&quot; quickly told us that the word &quot;to&quot; was used sixteen times in the first three paragraphs of this chapter.</p>
<p>This very fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is why you need to become skilled at talking &quot;computer language&quot;. Once you learn this new language, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner (the computer), leaving more time for you to do the things that you are uniquely suited for. You bring creativity, intuition, and inventiveness to this partnership.</p>
<h2 id="creativity-and-motivation"><a href="#creativity-and-motivation">Creativity and motivation</a></h2>
<p>While this book is not intended for professional programmers, professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of your choice.</p>
<p>If we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers, perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:</p>
<figure id="fig2.1.3"><img src="../img/programers-talking-to-you.svg" alt="Programmers Talking to You"><figcaption>Imagen - Programmers Talking to You</figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start, you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.</p>
<h2 id="computer-hardware-architecture"><a href="#computer-hardware-architecture">Computer hardware architecture</a></h2>
<p>Before we start learning the language we speak to give instructions to computers to develop software, we need to learn a small amount about how computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:</p>
<figure id="fig2.1.4"><img src="../img/hardware-architecture.svg" alt="Hardware Archicture"><figcaption>Imagen - Hardware Archicture</figcaption></figure>
<p>The high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#central-processing-unit" class="glossary-term" title="The heart of any computer. It is what runs the software that we write; also called &quot;CPU&quot; or &quot;the processor&quot;.">Central Processing Unit</a></strong> (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with &quot;what is next?&quot; If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask &quot;What next?&quot; three billion times per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">Main Memory</a></strong> is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a> is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information stored in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a> vanishes when the computer is turned off.</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.">Secondary Memory</a></strong> is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data.

The advantage of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off.

Examples of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory.

<li>The <strong>Input and Output Devices</strong> are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with the computer.</li>
<li>These days, most computers also have a <strong>Network Connection</strong> to retrieve information over a network. We can think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data that might not always be &quot;up&quot;. So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.">Secondary Memory</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these different parts as we write our programs.</p>
<p>As a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be &quot;talking&quot; to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a>, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off.

<figure id="fig2.1.5"><img src="../img/where-r-you.svg" alt="Where Are you?"><figcaption>Imagen - Where Are you?</figcaption></figure>
<p>You need to be the person who answers the CPU&apos;s &quot;What next?&quot; question. But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and insert you into the computer just so you could issue a command three billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a></strong> and the act of writing these instructions down and getting the instructions to be correct <strong>programming</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-programming"><a href="#understanding-programming">Understanding programming</a></h2>
<p>In the rest of this book, we will try to turn you into a person who is skilled in the art of programming. In the end you will be a <strong>programmer</strong> - perhaps not a professional programmer, but at least you will have the skills to look at a data/information analysis problem and develop a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to solve the problem.</p>
<p>In a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed &quot;sentences&quot; in this new language.</li>
<li>Second, you need to &quot;tell a story&quot;. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is the &quot;story&quot; and the problem you are trying to solve is the &quot;idea&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it much easier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++. The new programming language has very different vocabulary and grammar but the problem-solving skills will be the same across all programming languages.</p>
<p>You will learn the &quot;vocabulary&quot; and &quot;sentences&quot; of Python pretty quickly. It will take longer for you to be able to write a coherent <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write increasingly complex programs over time. At some point you &quot;get your muse&quot; and see the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant and creative process.</p>
<p>We start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be patient as the simple examples remind you of when you started reading for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="words-and-sentences"><a href="#words-and-sentences">Words and sentences</a></h2>
<p>Unlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We call this &quot;vocabulary&quot; the &quot;reserved words&quot;. These are words that have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called <strong>variables</strong>. You will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of Python&apos;s reserved words as a name for a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a>.</p>
<p>When we train a dog, we use special words like &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;stay&quot;, and &quot;fetch&quot;. When you talk to a dog and don&apos;t use any of the reserved words, they just look at you with a quizzical look on their face until you say a reserved word. For example, if you say, &quot;I wish more people would walk to improve their overall health&quot;, what most dogs likely hear is, &quot;blah blah blah <strong>walk</strong> blah blah blah blah.&quot; That is because &quot;walk&quot; is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the language between humans and cats has no reserved words<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the following:</p>
<pre><code>and       del       global      not       with
as        elif      if          or        yield
assert    else      import      pass      
break     except    in          raise
class     finally   is          return
continue  for       lambda      try
def       from      nonlocal    while
</code></pre><p>That is it, and unlike a dog, Python is already completely trained. When you say &quot;try&quot;, Python will try every time you say it without fail.</p>
<p>We will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time, but for now we will focus on the Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#equivalent" class="glossary-term" title="Having the same value.">equivalent</a> of &quot;speak&quot; (in human-to-dog language). The nice thing about telling Python to speak is that we can even tell it what to say by giving it a message in quotes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">print(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello world!&apos;</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And we have even written our first syntactically correct Python sentence. Our sentence starts with the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.">function</a> <strong>print</strong> followed by a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> of text of our choosing enclosed in single quotes.</p>
<h2 id="conversing-with-python"><a href="#conversing-with-python">Conversing with Python</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have a word and a simple sentence that we know in Python, we need to know how to start a conversation with Python to test our new language skills.</p>
<p>Before you can converse with Python, you must first install the Python software on your computer and learn how to start Python on your computer. That is too much detail for this chapter so I suggest that you consult <a href="http://www.py4e.com" target="_blank">www.py4e.com</a> where I have detailed instructions and screencasts of setting up and starting Python on Macintosh and Windows systems. At some point, you will be in a terminal or command window and you will <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> <strong>python</strong> and the Python interpreter will start executing in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#interactive-mode" class="glossary-term" title="A way of using the Python interpreter by typing commands and expressions at the prompt.">interactive mode</a> and appear somewhat as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:54:25)

    Type <span class="hljs-string">&quot;help&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;copyright&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;credits&quot;</span> or <span class="hljs-string">&quot;license&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> more information.
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#prompt" class="glossary-term" title="When a program displays a message and pauses for the user to type some input to the program.">prompt</a> is the Python interpreter&apos;s way of asking you, &quot;What do you want me to do next?&quot; Python is ready to have a conversation with you. All you have to know is how to speak the Python language.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s say for example that you did not know even the simplest Python language words or sentences. You might want to use the standard line that astronauts use when they land on a faraway planet and try to speak with the inhabitants of the planet:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; I come <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> peace, please take me to your leader
      File <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
        I come <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> peace, please take me to your leader
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is not going so well. Unless you think of something quickly, the inhabitants of the planet are likely to stab you with their spears, put you on a spit, roast you over a fire, and eat you for dinner.</p>
<p>Luckily you brought a copy of this book on your travels, and you thumb to this very page and try again:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello world!&apos;</span>)
    Hello world!
</code></pre>
<p>This is looking much better, so you try to communicate some more:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&apos;You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky&apos;)
    You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&apos;We have been waiting for you for a long time&apos;)
    We have been waiting for you for a long time
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&apos;Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard&apos;)
    Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print &apos;We will have a feast tonight unless you say
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        print &apos;We will have a feast tonight unless you say
                                                         ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to &apos;print&apos;
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The conversation was going so well for a while and then you made the tiniest mistake using the Python language and Python brought the spears back out.</p>
<p>At this point, you should also realize that while Python is amazingly complex and powerful and very picky about the syntax you use to communicate with it, Python is <strong>not</strong> intelligent. You are really just having a conversation with yourself, but using proper syntax.</p>
<p>In a sense, when you use a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> written by someone else the conversation is between you and those other programmers with Python acting as an intermediary. Python is a way for the creators of programs to express how the conversation is supposed to proceed. And in just a few more chapters, you will be one of those programmers using Python to talk to the users of your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<p>Before we leave our first conversation with the Python interpreter, you should probably know the proper way to say &quot;good-bye&quot; when interacting with the inhabitants of Planet Python:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; good-bye
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &apos;good&apos; is not defined
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if you don&apos;t mind, I need to leave
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        if you don&apos;t mind, I need to leave
                 ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; quit()
</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the error is different for the first two incorrect attempts. The second error is different because <strong>if</strong> is a reserved word and Python saw the reserved word and thought we were trying to say something but got the syntax of the sentence wrong.</p>
<p>The proper way to say &quot;good-bye&quot; to Python is to enter <strong>quit()</strong> or <strong>exit()</strong> at the interactive chevron <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#prompt" class="glossary-term" title="When a program displays a message and pauses for the user to type some input to the program.">prompt</a>. It would have probably taken you quite a while to guess that one, so having a book handy probably will turn out to be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="terminology-interpreter-and-compiler"><a href="#terminology-interpreter-and-compiler">Terminology: interpreter and compiler</a></h2>
<p>Python is a <strong>high-level</strong> language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#central-processing-unit" class="glossary-term" title="The heart of any computer. It is what runs the software that we write; also called &quot;CPU&quot; or &quot;the processor&quot;.">Central Processing Unit</a> (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.</p>
<p>The CPU understands a language we call <strong>machine language</strong>. Machine language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    001010001110100100101010000001111
    11100110000011101010010101101101
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.</p>
<p>Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not <strong>portable</strong> across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> for the new machine.</p>
<p>These programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.</p>
<p>An <strong>interpreter</strong> reads the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> as written by the programmer, parses the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a>, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> another line of Python.</p>
<p>Some of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> for later. We need to pick a name for that <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> later. We use the term <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a></strong> to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
    <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; y = x * <span class="hljs-number">7</span>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(y)
    <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we ask Python to remember the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> six and use the label <strong>x</strong> so we can retrieve the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> using <strong>print</strong>. Then we ask Python to retrieve <strong>x</strong> and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> in <strong>y</strong>. Then we ask Python to print out the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> currently in <strong>y</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are writing our first simple paragraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order.</p>
<p>It is the nature of an <strong>interpreter</strong> to be able to have an interactive conversation as shown above. A <strong>compiler</strong> needs to be handed the entire <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs have a suffix of &quot;.exe&quot; or &quot;.dll&quot; which stand for &quot;executable&quot; and &quot;dynamic link library&quot; respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.</p>
<p>If you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    ^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\xa0\x82
    ^D^H4^@^@^@\x90^]^@^@^@^@^@^@4^@ ^@^G^@(^@$^@!^@^F^@

    ^@^@^@^S^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^A^@^@^@^A\^D^HQVhT\x83^D^H\xe8
    ....
</code></pre>
<p>It is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have <strong>interpreters</strong> and <strong>compilers</strong> that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.</p>
<p>Now at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> &quot;python&quot;, what exactly is happening?</p>
<p>The Python interpreter is written in a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#high-level-language" class="glossary-term" title="A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.">high-level language</a> called &quot;C&quot;. You can look at the actual <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> for the Python interpreter by going to <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">www.python.org</a> and working your way to their <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a>. So Python is a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> itself and it is compiled into <a href="GLOSSARY.html#machine-code" class="glossary-term" title="The lowest-level language for software, which is the language that is directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU).">machine code</a>. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> onto your system. In Windows, the executable <a href="GLOSSARY.html#machine-code" class="glossary-term" title="The lowest-level language for software, which is the language that is directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU).">machine code</a> for Python itself is likely in a file with a name like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    C:\Python35\python.exe
</code></pre>
<p>That is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but sometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-program"><a href="#writing-a-program">Writing a program</a></h2>
<p>Typing commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with Python&apos;s features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems.</p>
<p>When we want to write a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, we use a text editor to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a <strong>script</strong>. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with <code>.py</code>.</p>
<p>To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the file. In a Unix or Windows command window, you would <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> <code>python hello.py</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    csev$ cat hello.py
    print(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello world!&apos;</span>)
    csev$ python hello.py
    Hello world!
    csev$
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;csev$&quot; is the operating system <a href="GLOSSARY.html#prompt" class="glossary-term" title="When a program displays a message and pauses for the user to type some input to the program.">prompt</a>, and the &quot;cat hello.py&quot; is showing us that the file &quot;hello.py&quot; has a one-line Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to print a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a>.</p>
<p>We call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> from the file &quot;hello.py&quot; instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively.</p>
<p>You will notice that there was no need to have <strong>quit()</strong> at the end of the Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> in the file. When Python is reading your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> from a file, it knows to stop when it reaches the end of the file.</p>

<p>The definition of a <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a></strong> at its most basic is a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Even our simple <strong>hello.py</strong> script is a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. It is a one-line <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> and is not particularly useful, but in the strictest definition, it is a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<p>It might be easiest to understand what a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is by thinking about a problem that a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> might be built to solve, and then looking at a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> that would solve that problem.</p>
<p>Lets say you are doing Social Computing research on Facebook posts and you are interested in the most frequently used word in a series of posts. You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most common word, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something fun.</p>
<p>For example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at the text and figure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    the clown ran after the car and the car ran into the tent
    and the tent fell down on the clown and the car
</code></pre>
<p>Then imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of text. Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to count the words than it would be to manually scan the words.</p>
<p>The even better news is that I already came up with a simple <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to find the most common word in a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#text-file" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of characters stored in permanent storage like a hard drive.">text file</a>. I wrote it, tested it, and now I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time.</p>

<p>You don&apos;t even need to know Python to use this <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. You will need to get through Chapter 10 of this book to fully understand the awesome Python techniques that were used to make the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. You are the end user, you simply use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> and marvel at its cleverness and how it saved you so much manual effort. You simply <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> the code into a file called <strong>words.py</strong> and run it or you download the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#source-code" class="glossary-term" title="A program in a high-level language.">source code</a> from <a href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/" target="_blank">http://www.py4e.com/code3/</a> and run it.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an intermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer). Python is a way for us to exchange useful instruction sequences (i.e., programs) in a common language that can be used by anyone who installs Python on their computer. So neither of us are talking <strong>to Python</strong>, instead we are communicating with each other <strong>through</strong> Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-building-blocks-of-programs"><a href="#the-building-blocks-of-programs">The building blocks of programs</a></h2>
<p>In the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary, sentence structure, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python. We will learn about the powerful capabilities of Python and how to compose those capabilities together to create useful programs.</p>
<p>There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs. These constructs are not just for Python programs, they are part of every programming language from machine language up to the high-level languages.</p>
<h4 id="input">input</h4>
<p>Get data from the &quot;outside world&quot;. This might be reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.</p>
<h4 id="output">output</h4>
<p>Display the results of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> on a screen or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.</p>
<h4 id="sequential-execution">sequential execution</h4>
<p>Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.</p>
<h4 id="conditional-execution">conditional execution</h4>
<p>Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> of statements.</p>
<h4 id="repeated-execution">repeated execution</h4>
<p>Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
<h4 id="reuse">reuse</h4>
<p>Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<p>It sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so simple. It is like saying that walking is simply &quot;putting one foot in front of the other&quot;. The &quot;art&quot; of writing a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is composing and weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce something that is useful to its users.</p>
<p>The word counting <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> above directly uses all of these patterns except for one.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong"><a href="#what-could-possibly-go-wrong">What could possibly go wrong?</a></h2>
<p>As we saw in our earliest conversations with Python, we must communicate very precisely when we write Python code. The smallest deviation or mistake will cause Python to give up looking at your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers often take the fact that Python leaves no room for errors as evidence that Python is mean, hateful, and cruel. While Python seems to like everyone else, Python knows them personally and holds a grudge against them. Because of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly written programs and rejects them as &quot;unfit&quot; just to torment us.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; primt <span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello world!&apos;</span>

<p>There is little to be gained by arguing with Python. It is just a tool. It has no emotions and it is happy and ready to serve you whenever you need it. Its error messages sound harsh, but they are just Python&apos;s call for help. It has looked at what you typed, and it simply cannot understand what you have entered.</p>
<p>Python is much more like a dog, loving you unconditionally, having a few <a href="GLOSSARY.html#key" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.">key</a> words that it understands, looking you with a sweet look on its face (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), and waiting for you to say something it understands. When Python says &quot;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&quot;, it is simply wagging its tail and saying, &quot;You seemed to say something but I just don&apos;t understand what you meant, but please keep talking to me (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).&quot;</p>
<p>As your programs become increasingly sophisticated, you will encounter three general types of errors:</p>
<h4 id="syntax-errors">Syntax errors</h4>
<p>These are the first errors you will make and the easiest to fix. A syntax error means that you have violated the &quot;grammar&quot; rules of Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> than where Python <strong>noticed</strong> it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.</p>
<h4 id="logic-errors">Logic errors</h4>
<p>A logic error is when your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be, &quot;take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="semantic-errors">Semantic errors</h4>
<p>A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#semantic-error" class="glossary-term" title="An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.">semantic error</a> is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is perfectly correct but it does not do what you <strong>intended</strong> for it to do. A simple example would be if you were giving a person directions to a restaurant and said, &quot;...when you reach the intersection with the gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red building on your left.&quot; Your friend is very late and calls you to tell you that they are on a farm and walking around behind a barn, with no sign of a restaurant. Then you say &quot;did you turn left or right at the gas station?&quot; and they say, &quot;I followed your directions perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one mile at the gas station.&quot; Then you say, &quot;I am very sorry, because while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small but undetected <a href="GLOSSARY.html#semantic-error" class="glossary-term" title="An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.">semantic error</a>.&quot;.</p>
<p>Again in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest to do exactly what you have asked.</p>
<h2 id="the-learning-journey"><a href="#the-learning-journey">The learning journey</a></h2>
<p>As you progress through the rest of the book, don&apos;t be afraid if the concepts don&apos;t seem to fit together well the first time. When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences and took 5-6 more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.</p>
<p>We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don&apos;t hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the &quot;why?&quot; of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.</p>
<p>Usually when you are learning your first programming language, there are a few wonderful &quot;Ah Hah!&quot; moments where you can look up from pounding away at some rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture.</p>
<p>If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no <a href="GLOSSARY.html#value" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word &quot;value&quot;.">value</a> in staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it.</p>
