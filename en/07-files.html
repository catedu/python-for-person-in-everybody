<h2 id="persistence">Persistence </h2>
<p>So far, we have learned how to write programs and communicate our intentions to the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#central-processing-unit" class="glossary-term" title="The heart of any computer. It is what runs the software that we write; also called &quot;CPU&quot; or &quot;the processor&quot;.">Central Processing Unit</a></strong> using conditional execution, functions, and iterations. We have learned how to create and use data structures in the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">Main Memory</a></strong>. The CPU and memory are where our software works and runs. It is where all of the &quot;thinking&quot; happens.</p>
<p>But if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the power is turned off, anything stored in either the CPU or <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a> is erased. So up to now, our programs have just been transient fun exercises to learn Python.</p>
<figure id="fig2.7.1"><img src="../img/seconday_memory.svg" alt="Secondary memory"><figcaption>Imagen - <a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.">Secondary memory</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In this chapter, we start to work with <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.">Secondary Memory</a></strong> (or files). <a href="GLOSSARY.html#secondary-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.">Secondary memory</a> is not erased when the power is turned off. Or in the case of a USB flash drive, the data we write from our programs can be removed from the system and transported to another system.</p>
<p>We will primarily focus on reading and writing text files such as those we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work with database files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read and written through database software.</p>
<h2 id="opening-files">Opening files </h2>
<p>When we want to read or write a file (say on your hard drive), we first must <strong>open</strong> the file. Opening the file communicates with your operating system, which knows where the data for each file is stored. When you open a file, you are asking the operating system to find the file by name and make sure the file exists. In this example, we open the file <code>mbox.txt</code>, which should be stored in the same folder that you are in when you start Python. You can download this file from <a href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt" target="_blank">www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>fhand = open(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;mbox.txt&apos;</span>)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>print(fhand)
&lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name=<span class="hljs-string">&apos;mbox.txt&apos;</span> mode=<span class="hljs-string">&apos;r&apos;</span> encoding=<span class="hljs-string">&apos;cp1252&apos;</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>open</code> is successful, the operating system returns us a <strong>file handle</strong>. The file handle is not the actual data contained in the file, but instead it is a &quot;handle&quot; that we can use to read the data. You are given a handle if the requested file exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.</p>
<figure id="fig2.7.2"><img src="../img/file-handle.svg" alt="A File Handle"><figcaption>Imagen - A File Handle</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the file does not exist, <code>open</code> will fail with a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#traceback" class="glossary-term" title="A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.">traceback</a> and you will not get a handle to access the contents of the file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>fhand = open(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;stuff.txt&apos;</span>)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> &lt;module&gt;
FileNotFoundError: [Errno <span class="hljs-number">2</span>] No such file <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> directory: <span class="hljs-string">&apos;stuff.txt&apos;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Later we will use <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> to deal more gracefully with the situation where we attempt to open a file that does not exist.</p>
<h2 id="text-files-and-lines">Text files and lines </h2>
<p>A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#text-file" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of characters stored in permanent storage like a hard drive.">text file</a> can be thought of as a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> of lines, much like a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> can be thought of as a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> of characters.

<p>To break the file into lines, there is a special character that represents the &quot;end of the line&quot; called the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a></strong> character.</p>
<p>In Python, we represent the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a></strong> character as a backslash-n in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> constants. Even though this looks like two characters, it is actually a single character. When we look at the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> by entering &quot;stuff&quot; in the interpreter, it shows us the <code>\n</code> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a>, but when we use <code>print</code> to show the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a>, we see the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> broken into two lines by the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> character.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>stuff = <span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello\nWorld!&apos;</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>stuff
<span class="hljs-string">&apos;Hello\nWorld!&apos;</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>print(stuff)
Hello
World!
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>stuff = <span class="hljs-string">&apos;X\nY&apos;</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>print(stuff)

<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>len(stuff)
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also see that the length of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> <code>X\nY</code> is <strong>three</strong> characters because the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> character is a single character.</p>
<p>So when we look at the lines in a file, we need to <strong>imagine</strong> that there is a special invisible character called the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> at the end of each line that marks the end of the line.</p>
<p>So the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> character separates the characters in the file into lines.</p>
<h2 id="reading-files">Reading files </h2>
<p>While the <strong>file handle</strong> does not contain the data for the file, it is quite easy to construct a <code>for</code> loop to read through and count each of the lines in a file:</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/971f4a72f3" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We can use the file handle as the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#sequence" class="glossary-term" title="An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.">sequence</a> in our <code>for</code> loop. Our <code>for</code> loop simply counts the number of lines in the file and prints them out. The rough translation of the <code>for</code> loop into English is, &quot;for each line in the file represented by the file handle, add one to the <code>count</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>The reason that the <code>open</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.">function</a> does not read the entire file is that the file might be quite large with many gigabytes of data. The <code>open</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#statement" class="glossary-term" title="A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements we have seen are assignments and print expression statement.">statement</a> takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the file. The <code>for</code> loop actually causes the data to be read from the file.</p>
<p>When the file is read using a <code>for</code> loop in this manner, Python takes care of splitting the data in the file into separate lines using the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> character. Python reads each line through the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> and includes the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> as the last character in the <code>line</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> for each <a href="GLOSSARY.html#iteration" class="glossary-term" title="Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function that calls itself or a loop.">iteration</a> of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>Because the <code>for</code> loop reads the data one line at a time, it can efficiently read and count the lines in very large files without running out of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a> to store the data. The above <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> can count the lines in any size file using very little memory since each line is read, counted, and then discarded.</p>
<p>If you know the file is relatively small compared to the size of your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a>, you can read the whole file into one <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> using the <code>read</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> on the file handle.</p>

<p>In this example, the entire contents (all 94,626 characters) of the file <code>mbox-short.txt</code> are read directly into the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> <code>inp</code>. We use <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> slicing to print out the first 20 characters of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> data stored in <code>inp</code>.</p>
<p>When the file is read in this manner, all the characters including all of the lines and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> characters are one big <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> <strong>inp</strong>. Remember that this form of the <code>open</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.

Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a> of your computer.</p>
<p>If the file is too large to fit in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#main-memory" class="glossary-term" title="Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.">main memory</a>, you should write your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> to read the file in chunks using a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<h2 id="searching-through-a-file">Searching through a file </h2>
<p>When you are searching through data in a file, it is a very common pattern to read through a file, ignoring most of the lines and only processing lines which meet a particular <a href="GLOSSARY.html#condition" class="glossary-term" title="The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.">condition</a>. We can combine the pattern for reading a file with <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> methods to build simple <a href="GLOSSARY.html#search" class="glossary-term" title="A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.">search</a> mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to read a file and only print out lines which started with the prefix &quot;From:&quot;, we could use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class.

<p>The output looks great since the only lines we are seeing are those which start with &quot;From:&quot;, but why are we seeing the extra blank lines? This is due to that invisible <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a></strong> character. Each of the lines ends with a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a>, so the <code>print</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#statement" class="glossary-term" title="A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements we have seen are assignments and print expression statement.">statement</a> prints the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> <strong>line</strong> which includes a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> and then <code>print</code> adds <strong>another</strong> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a>, resulting in the double spacing effect we see.</p>
<p>We could use line slicing to print all but the last character, but a simpler approach is to use the <strong>rstrip</strong> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class.

<p>As your file processing programs get more complicated, you may want to structure your <a href="GLOSSARY.html#search" class="glossary-term" title="A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.">search</a> loops using <code>continue</code>. The basic idea of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#search" class="glossary-term" title="A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.">search</a> loop is that you are looking for &quot;interesting&quot; lines and effectively skipping &quot;uninteresting&quot; lines. And then when we find an interesting line, we do something with that line.</p>
<p>We can structure the loop to follow the pattern of skipping uninteresting lines as follows:</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/c175b5a15f" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The output of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is the same. In English, the uninteresting lines are those which do not start with &quot;From:&quot;, which we skip using <code>continue</code>. For the &quot;interesting&quot; lines (i.e., those that start with &quot;From:&quot;) we perform the processing on those lines.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>find</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class.

<p>Do not laugh. Users will eventually do every possible thing they can do to break your programs, either on purpose or with malicious intent.

<p>Again, the file <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> keeps track of where it is, so if you call <code>write</code> again, it adds the new data to the end.</p>
<p>We must make sure to manage the ends of lines as we write to the file by explicitly inserting the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> character when we want to end a line. The <code>print</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#statement" class="glossary-term" title="A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements we have seen are assignments and print expression statement.">statement</a> automatically appends a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a>, but the <code>write</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> does not add the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a> automatically.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>line2 = <span class="hljs-string">&apos;the emblem of our land.\n&apos;</span>

<p>When you are done writing, you have to close the file to make sure that the last bit of data is physically written to the disk so it will not be lost if the power goes off.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>fout.close()
</code></pre>
<p>We could close the files which we open for read as well, but we can be a little sloppy if we are only opening a few files since Python makes sure that all open files are closed when the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> ends. When we are writing files, we want to explicitly close the files so as to leave nothing to chance.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging </h2>
<p>When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs, and newlines are normally invisible:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = <span class="hljs-string">&apos;1 2\t 3\n 4&apos;</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>print(s)
<span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>  <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
 <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The built-in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.">function</a> <code>repr</code> can help. It takes any <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> as an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#argument" class="glossary-term" title="A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.">argument</a> and returns a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> representation of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>print(repr(s))
<span class="hljs-string">&apos;1 2\t 3\n 4&apos;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This can be helpful for debugging.</p>
<p>One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#newline" class="glossary-term" title="A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.">newline</a>, represented <code>\n</code>. Others use a return character, represented <code>\r</code>. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies might cause problems.</p>
<p>For most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can find them (and read more about this issue) at <a href="wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</a>. Or, of course, you could write one yourself.</p>
