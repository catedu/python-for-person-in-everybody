<h2 id="managing-larger-programs">Managing Larger Programs </h2>
<p>At the beginning of this book, we came up with four basic programming patterns which we use to construct programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sequential code</li>
<li>Conditional code (if statements)</li>
<li>Repetitive code (loops)</li>
<li>Store and reuse (functions)</li>
</ul>
<p>In later chapters, we explored simple variables as well as collection data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.</p>
<p>As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate those data structures. There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are &quot;not so elegant&quot; and other programs that are &quot;more elegant&quot;. Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of &quot;art&quot; and &quot;aesthetic&quot; to writing code.</p>
<p>As programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. If you are working on a million line <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, you can never keep the entire <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> in your mind at the same time. So we need ways to break the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> into multiple smaller pieces so to solve a problem, fix a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#bug" class="glossary-term" title="An error in a program.">bug</a>, or add a new feature we have less to look at.</p>
<p>In a way, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 500 lines of the code, and understand it while ignoring the other 999,500 lines of code for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started </h2>
<p>Like many aspects of programming it is necessary to learn the concepts of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented programming before you can use them effectively. So approach this chapter as a way to learn some terms and concepts and work through a few simple examples to lay a foundation for future learning. Throughout the rest of the book we will be using objects in many of the programs but we won&apos;t be building our own new objects in the programs.</p>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#key" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.">key</a> outcome of this chapter is to have a basic understanding of how objects are constructed and how they <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.">function</a> and most importantly how we make use of the capabilities of objects that are provided to us by Python and Python libraries.</p>
<h2 id="using-objects">Using Objects </h2>
<p>It turns out we have been using objects all along in this <a href="GLOSSARY.html#class" class="glossary-term" title="A template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object.">class</a>. Python provides us with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the first few lines should feel very simple and natural to you.</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/27adad9e85" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>But instead of focusing on what these lines accomplish, lets look at what is really happening from the point of view of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>-oriented programming. Don&apos;t worry if the following paragraphs don&apos;t make any sense the first time you read them because we have not yet defined all these terms.</p>
<p>The first line is <strong>constructing</strong> an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a></strong>, the second and third lines are calling the <code>append()</code> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a></strong>, the fourth line is calling the <code>sort()</code> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a></strong>, and the fifth line is retrieving the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#item" class="glossary-term" title="Another name for a key-value pair.">item</a> at position 0.</p>
<p>The sixth line is calling the <code>__getitem__()</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> in the <code>stuff</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a> with a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#parameter" class="glossary-term" title="A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.">parameter</a> of zero.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> (stuff.__getitem__(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>))
</code></pre>
<p>The seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th <a href="GLOSSARY.html#item" class="glossary-term" title="Another name for a key-value pair.">item</a> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> (list.__getitem__(stuff,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>))
</code></pre>

<p>The precise definition of <code>dir()</code> is that it lists the <strong>methods</strong> and <strong>attributes</strong> of a Python <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-programs">Starting with Programs </h2>
<p>A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> in its most basic form takes some input, does some processing, and produces some output. Our elevator conversion <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> demonstrates a very short but complete <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> showing all three of these steps.</p>

<p>If we think a bit more about this <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, there is the &quot;outside world&quot; and the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. The input and output aspects are where the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> interacts with the outside world. Within the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> we have code and data to accomplish the task the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is designed to solve.</p>
<figure id="fig2.14.1"><img src="../img/input-output.svg" alt="A program"><figcaption>Imagen - A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>When we are &quot;in&quot; the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>, we have some defined interactions with the &quot;outside&quot; world, but those interactions are well defined and generally not something we focus on. While we are coding we worry only about the details &quot;inside the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>One way to think about <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented programming is that we are separating our <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> into multiple &quot;zones&quot;. Each &quot;zone&quot; contains some code and data (like a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>) and has well defined interactions with the outside world and the other zones within the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<p>If we look back at the link extraction application where we used the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#beautifulsoup" class="glossary-term" title="A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com.">BeautifulSoup</a> library, we can see a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> that is constructed by connecting different objects together to accomplish a task:</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/9bb573e676" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We read the URL into a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a>, and then pass that into <code>urllib</code> to retrieve the data from the web. The <code>urllib</code> library uses the <code>socket</code> library to make the actual network connection to retrieve the data. We take the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#string" class="glossary-term" title="A type that represents sequences of characters.">string</a> that we get back from <code>urllib</code> and hand it to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#beautifulsoup" class="glossary-term" title="A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore.

An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> called <code>html.parser</code><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> and returns an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>. We call the <code>tags()</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> in the returned <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> and then get a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#dictionary" class="glossary-term" title="A mapping from a set of keys to their corresponding values.">dictionary</a> of tag objects, and loop through the tags and call the <code>get()</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> for each tag to print out the &apos;href&apos; <a href="GLOSSARY.html#attribute" class="glossary-term" title="One of the values within a tuple.

<p>We can draw a picture of this <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> and how the objects work together.</p>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#key" class="glossary-term" title="An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.">key</a> here is not to fully understand how this <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> works but to see how we build a network of interacting objects and orchestrate the movement of information between the objects to create a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>. It is also important to note that when you looked at that <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> several chapters back, you could fully understand what was going on in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> without even realizing that the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> was &quot;orchestrating the movement of data between objects&quot;. Back then it was just lines of code that got the job done.</p>
<h2 id="subdividing-a-problem---encapsulation">Subdividing a Problem - Encapsulation </h2>
<p>One of the advantages of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented approach is that it can hide complexity. For example, while we need to know how to use the <code>urllib</code> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#beautifulsoup" class="glossary-term" title="A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com.">BeautifulSoup</a> code, we do not need to know how those libraries work internally. It allows us to focus on the part of the problem we need to solve and ignore the other parts of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig2.14.3"><img src="../img/ignoring-details.svg" alt="Ignoring Detail When Using an Object"><figcaption>Imagen - Ignoring Detail When Using an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class.

<p>This ability to focus on a part of a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> that we care about and ignore the rest of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> is also helpful to the developers of the objects. For example the programmers developing <a href="GLOSSARY.html#beautifulsoup" class="glossary-term" title="A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com.">BeautifulSoup</a> do not need to know or care about how we retrieve our HTML page, what parts we want to read or what we plan to do with the data we extract from the web page.</p>

<p>Another word we use to capture this idea that we ignore the internal detail of objects we use is &quot;encapsulation&quot;. This means that we can know how to use an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> without knowing how it internally accomplishes what we need done.</p>

Defining a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#function" class="glossary-term" title="A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.

<p>An <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class.

<h2 id="classes-as-types">Classes as Types </h2>
<p>As we have seen, in Python, all variables have a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#type" class="glossary-term" title="A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).">type</a>.

<h2 id="summary">Summary </h2>
<p>This is a very quick introduction to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>-oriented programming that focuses mainly on terminology and the syntax of defining and using objects. Let&apos;s quickly review the code that we looked at in the beginning of the chapter. At this point you should fully understand what is going on.</p>

<p>The first line constructs a <code>list</code> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a></strong>. When Python creates the <code>list</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>, it calls the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#constructor" class="glossary-term" title="An optional specially named method (init) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object.">constructor</a></strong> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> (named <code>__init__</code>) to set up the internal data attributes that will be used to store the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a> data. Due to <strong>encapsulation</strong> we neither need to know, nor need to care about these in internal data attributes are arranged.</p>
<p>We are not passing any parameters to the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#constructor" class="glossary-term" title="An optional specially named method (init) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object.">constructor</a></strong> and when the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#constructor" class="glossary-term" title="An optional specially named method (init) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object.">constructor</a> returns, we use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#variable" class="glossary-term" title="A name that refers to a value.">variable</a> <code>stuff</code> to point to the returned instance of the <code>list</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#class" class="glossary-term" title="A template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object.">class</a>.</p>
<p>The second and third lines are calling the <code>append</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> with one <a href="GLOSSARY.html#parameter" class="glossary-term" title="A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.">parameter</a> to add a new <a href="GLOSSARY.html#item" class="glossary-term" title="Another name for a key-value pair.">item</a> at the end of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a> by updating the attributes within <code>stuff</code>. Then in the fourth line, we call the <code>sort</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> with no parameters to sort the data within the <code>stuff</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a>.</p>
<p>Then we print out the first <a href="GLOSSARY.html#item" class="glossary-term" title="Another name for a key-value pair.">item</a> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#list" class="glossary-term" title="A sequence of values.">list</a> using the square brackets which are a shortcut to calling the <code>__getitem__</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> within the <code>stuff</code> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a></strong>. And this is <a href="GLOSSARY.html#equivalent" class="glossary-term" title="Having the same value.">equivalent</a> to calling the <code>__getitem__</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#method" class="glossary-term" title="A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use &apos;message&apos; instead of &apos;method&apos; to describe this concept.">method</a> in the <code>list</code> <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#class" class="glossary-term" title="A template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object.">class</a></strong> passing the <code>stuff</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> in as the first <a href="GLOSSARY.html#parameter" class="glossary-term" title="A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.">parameter</a> and the position we are looking for as the second <a href="GLOSSARY.html#parameter" class="glossary-term" title="A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.">parameter</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#program" class="glossary-term" title="A set of instructions that specifies a computation.">program</a> the <code>stuff</code> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> is discarded but not before calling the <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#destructor" class="glossary-term" title="An optional specially named method (del) that is called at the moment just before an object is destroyed. Destructors are rarely used.">destructor</a></strong> (named <code>__del__</code>) so the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> can clean up any loose ends as necessary.</p>
<p>Those are the basics and terminology of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented programming. There are many additional details as to how to best use <a href="GLOSSARY.html#object" class="glossary-term" title="A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term &apos;instance&apos; interchangeably with &apos;object&apos;.">object</a> oriented approaches when developing large applications and libraries that are beyond the scope of this chapter.<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="reffn_3">3</a></sup></p>
