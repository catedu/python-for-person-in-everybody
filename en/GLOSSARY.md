## child class
A new class created when a parent class is extended. The child class inherits all of the attributes and methods of the parent class.

## attribute
One of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a "column" or "field".

## cursor
A cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network connections and files, respectively.

## database browser

## logical key
A key that the "outside world" uses to look up a particular row. For example in a table of user accounts, a person's email address might be a good candidate as the logical key for the user's data.

## normalization
Designing a data model so that no data is replicated. We store each item of data at one place in the database and reference it elsewhere using a foreign key.

## primary key
A numeric key assigned to each row that is used to refer to one row in a table from another table. Often the database is configured to automatically assign primary keys as rows are inserted.

## relation
An area within a database that contains tuples and attributes. More typically called a "table".

## tuple
A single entry in a database table that is a set of attributes. More typically called "row".
