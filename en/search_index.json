Starting the journey","keywords":"","body":"\nWhy should you learn to write programs?\nCreativity and motivation\nComputer hardware architecture\nUnderstanding programming\nWords and sentences\nConversing with Python\nTerminology: interpreter and compiler\nWriting a program\nWhat is a program?\nThe building blocks of programs\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\nThe learning journey\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Python\nWe will just have to go to the web https://www.python.org/ and download the installer.\nThe steps vary somewhat between operating systems.\nAttention! In Windows, do not forget to add Python to the PATH in the first steps of installation:\nImagen - Installing Python\nOnce done, we will have Python accessible from the terminal.\n\nWhy should you learn to write programs?\nWriting programs (or programming) is a very creative and rewarding activity. You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem. This book assumes that everyone needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.\nWe are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging from laptops to cell phones. We can think of these computers as our \"personal assistants\" who can take care of many things on our behalf. The hardware in our current-day computers is essentially built to continuously ask us the question, \"What would you like me to do next?\"\nImagen - Personal Digital Assistant\nProgrammers add an operating system and a set of applications to the hardware and we end up with a Personal Digital Assistant that is quite helpful and capable of helping us do many different things.\nOur computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the computer what we would like it to \"do next\". If we knew this language, we could tell the computer to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring and mind-numbing.\nFor example, look at the first three paragraphs of this chapter and tell me the most commonly used word and how many times the word is used. While you were able to read and understand the words in a few seconds, counting them is almost painful because it is not the kind of problem that human minds are designed to solve. For a computer the opposite is true, reading and understanding text from a piece of paper is hard for a computer to do but counting the words and telling you how many times the most used word was used is very easy for the computer:\npython words.py\n Enter file:words.txt\n to 16\n\nOur \"personal information analysis assistant\" quickly told us that the word \"to\" was used sixteen times in the first three paragraphs of this chapter.\nThis very fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is why you need to become skilled at talking \"computer language\". Once you learn this new language, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner (the computer), leaving more time for you to do the things that you are uniquely suited for. You bring creativity, intuition, and inventiveness to this partnership.\nCreativity and motivation\nWhile this book is not intended for professional programmers, professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of your choice.\nIf we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers, perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:\nImagen - Programmers Talking to You\nFor now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start, you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.\nComputer hardware architecture\nBefore we start learning the language we speak to give instructions to computers to develop software, we need to learn a small amount about how computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:\nImagen - Hardware Archicture\nThe high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:\n\nThe Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with \"what is next?\" If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask \"What next?\" three billion times per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.\nThe Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.\nThe Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically found in USB sticks and portable music players).\nThe Input and Output Devices are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with the computer.\nThese days, most computers also have a Network Connection to retrieve information over a network. We can think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data that might not always be \"up\". So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of Secondary Memory.\n\nWhile most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these different parts as we write our programs.\nAs a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be \"talking\" to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices.\nImagen - Where Are you?\nYou need to be the person who answers the CPU's \"What next?\" question. But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and insert you into the computer just so you could issue a command three billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a program and the act of writing these instructions down and getting the instructions to be correct programming.\nUnderstanding programming\nIn the rest of this book, we will try to turn you into a person who is skilled in the art of programming. In the end you will be a programmer - perhaps not a professional programmer, but at least you will have the skills to look at a data/information analysis problem and develop a program to solve the problem.\nIn a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:\n\nFirst, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed \"sentences\" in this new language.\nSecond, you need to \"tell a story\". In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the \"story\" and the problem you are trying to solve is the \"idea\".\n\nOnce you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it much easier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++. The new programming language has very different vocabulary and grammar but the problem-solving skills will be the same across all programming languages.\nYou will learn the \"vocabulary\" and \"sentences\" of Python pretty quickly. It will take longer for you to be able to write a coherent program to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write increasingly complex programs over time. At some point you \"get your muse\" and see the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant and creative process.\nWe start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be patient as the simple examples remind you of when you started reading for the first time.\nWords and sentences\nUnlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We call this \"vocabulary\" the \"reserved words\". These are words that have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called variables. You will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of Python's reserved words as a name for a variable.\nWhen we train a dog, we use special words like \"sit\", \"stay\", and \"fetch\". When you talk to a dog and don't use any of the reserved words, they just look at you with a quizzical look on their face until you say a reserved word. For example, if you say, \"I wish more people would walk to improve their overall health\", what most dogs likely hear is, \"blah blah blah walk blah blah blah blah.\" That is because \"walk\" is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the language between humans and cats has no reserved words1.\nThe reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the following:\nand       del       global      not       with\nas        elif      if          or        yield\nassert    else      import      pass      \nbreak     except    in          raise\nclass     finally   is          return\ncontinue  for       lambda      try\ndef       from      nonlocal    while\nThat is it, and unlike a dog, Python is already completely trained. When you say \"try\", Python will try every time you say it without fail.\nWe will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time, but for now we will focus on the Python equivalent of \"speak\" (in human-to-dog language). The nice thing about telling Python to speak is that we can even tell it what to say by giving it a message in quotes:\nprint('Hello world!')\n\nAnd we have even written our first syntactically correct Python sentence. Our sentence starts with the function print followed by a string of text of our choosing enclosed in single quotes.\nConversing with Python\nNow that we have a word and a simple sentence that we know in Python, we need to know how to start a conversation with Python to test our new language skills.\nBefore you can converse with Python, you must first install the Python software on your computer and learn how to start Python on your computer. That is too much detail for this chapter so I suggest that you consult www.py4e.com where I have detailed instructions and screencasts of setting up and starting Python on Macintosh and Windows systems. At some point, you will be in a terminal or command window and you will type python and the Python interpreter will start executing in interactive mode and appear somewhat as follows:\n    Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:54:25)\n    [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    >>>\n\nThe >>> prompt is the Python interpreter's way of asking you, \"What do you want me to do next?\" Python is ready to have a conversation with you. All you have to know is how to speak the Python language.\nLet's say for example that you did not know even the simplest Python language words or sentences. You might want to use the standard line that astronauts use when they land on a faraway planet and try to speak with the inhabitants of the planet:\n    >>> I come in peace, please take me to your leader\n      File \"\", line 1\n        I come in peace, please take me to your leader\n             ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>>\n\nThis is not going so well. Unless you think of something quickly, the inhabitants of the planet are likely to stab you with their spears, put you on a spit, roast you over a fire, and eat you for dinner.\nLuckily you brought a copy of this book on your travels, and you thumb to this very page and try again:\n    >>> print('Hello world!')\n    Hello world!\n\nThis is looking much better, so you try to communicate some more:\n    >>> print('You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky')\n    You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky\n    >>> print('We have been waiting for you for a long time')\n    We have been waiting for you for a long time\n    >>> print('Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard')\n    Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard\n    >>> print 'We will have a feast tonight unless you say\n      File \"\", line 1\n        print 'We will have a feast tonight unless you say\n                                                         ^\n    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'\n    >>>\n\nThe conversation was going so well for a while and then you made the tiniest mistake using the Python language and Python brought the spears back out.\nAt this point, you should also realize that while Python is amazingly complex and powerful and very picky about the syntax you use to communicate with it, Python is not intelligent. You are really just having a conversation with yourself, but using proper syntax.\nIn a sense, when you use a program written by someone else the conversation is between you and those other programmers with Python acting as an intermediary. Python is a way for the creators of programs to express how the conversation is supposed to proceed. And in just a few more chapters, you will be one of those programmers using Python to talk to the users of your program.\nBefore we leave our first conversation with the Python interpreter, you should probably know the proper way to say \"good-bye\" when interacting with the inhabitants of Planet Python:\n    >>> good-bye\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"\", line 1, in \n    NameError: name 'good' is not defined\n    >>> if you don't mind, I need to leave\n      File \"\", line 1\n        if you don't mind, I need to leave\n                 ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>> quit()\n\nYou will notice that the error is different for the first two incorrect attempts. The second error is different because if is a reserved word and Python saw the reserved word and thought we were trying to say something but got the syntax of the sentence wrong.\nThe proper way to say \"good-bye\" to Python is to enter quit() or exit() at the interactive chevron >>> prompt. It would have probably taken you quite a while to guess that one, so having a book handy probably will turn out to be helpful.\nTerminology: interpreter and compiler\nPython is a high-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.\nThe CPU understands a language we call machine language. Machine language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:\n    001010001110100100101010000001111\n    11100110000011101010010101101101\n    ...\n\nMachine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.\nSince machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine.\nThese programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.\nAn interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.\nSome of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value later. We use the term variable to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.\n    >>> x = 6\n    >>> print(x)\n    6\n    >>> y = x * 7\n    >>> print(y)\n    42\n    >>>\n\nIn this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label x so we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve x and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed value in y. Then we ask Python to print out the value currently in y.\nEven though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are writing our first simple paragraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order.\nIt is the nature of an interpreter to be able to have an interactive conversation as shown above. A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution.\nIf you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs have a suffix of \".exe\" or \".dll\" which stand for \"executable\" and \"dynamic link library\" respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.\nIf you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable:\n    ^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\\xa0\\x82\n    ^D^H4^@^@^@\\x90^]^@^@^@^@^@^@4^@ ^@^G^@(^@$^@!^@^F^@\n    ^@^@4^@^@^@4\\x80^D^H4\\x80^D^H\\xe0^@^@^@\\xe0^@^@^@^E\n    ^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^C^@^@^@^T^A^@^@^T\\x81^D^H^T\\x81^D^H^S\n    ^@^@^@^S^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^A^@^@^@^A\\^D^HQVhT\\x83^D^H\\xe8\n    ....\n\nIt is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have interpreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.\nNow at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we type \"python\", what exactly is happening?\nThe Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called \"C\". You can look at the actual source code for the Python interpreter by going to www.python.org and working your way to their source code. So Python is a program itself and it is compiled into machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python program onto your system. In Windows, the executable machine code for Python itself is likely in a file with a name like:\n    C:\\Python35\\python.exe\n\nThat is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but sometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the beginning.\nWriting a program\nTyping commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with Python's features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems.\nWhen we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py.\nTo execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the file. In a Unix or Windows command window, you would type python hello.py as follows:\n    csev$ cat hello.py\n    print('Hello world!')\n    csev$ python hello.py\n    Hello world!\n    csev$\n\nThe \"csev$\" is the operating system prompt, and the \"cat hello.py\" is showing us that the file \"hello.py\" has a one-line Python program to print a string.\nWe call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from the file \"hello.py\" instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively.\nYou will notice that there was no need to have quit() at the end of the Python program in the file. When Python is reading your source code from a file, it knows to stop when it reaches the end of the file.\nWhat is a program?\nThe definition of a program at its most basic is a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Even our simple hello.py script is a program. It is a one-line program and is not particularly useful, but in the strictest definition, it is a Python program.\nIt might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a problem that a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a program that would solve that problem.\nLets say you are doing Social Computing research on Facebook posts and you are interested in the most frequently used word in a series of posts. You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most common word, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something fun.\nFor example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at the text and figure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.\n    the clown ran after the car and the car ran into the tent\n    and the tent fell down on the clown and the car\n\nThen imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of text. Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python program to count the words than it would be to manually scan the words.\nThe even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to find the most common word in a text file. I wrote it, tested it, and now I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time.\n\n\nYou don't even need to know Python to use this program. You will need to get through Chapter 10 of this book to fully understand the awesome Python techniques that were used to make the program. You are the end user, you simply use the program and marvel at its cleverness and how it saved you so much manual effort. You simply type the code into a file called words.py and run it or you download the source code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/ and run it.\nThis is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an intermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer). Python is a way for us to exchange useful instruction sequences (i.e., programs) in a common language that can be used by anyone who installs Python on their computer. So neither of us are talking to Python, instead we are communicating with each other through Python.\nThe building blocks of programs\nIn the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary, sentence structure, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python. We will learn about the powerful capabilities of Python and how to compose those capabilities together to create useful programs.\nThere are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs. These constructs are not just for Python programs, they are part of every programming language from machine language up to the high-level languages.\ninput\nGet data from the \"outside world\". This might be reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.\noutput\nDisplay the results of the program on a screen or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.\nsequential execution\nPerform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.\nconditional execution\nCheck for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of statements.\nrepeated execution\nPerform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation.\nreuse\nWrite a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program.\nIt sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so simple. It is like saying that walking is simply \"putting one foot in front of the other\". The \"art\" of writing a program is composing and weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce something that is useful to its users.\nThe word counting program above directly uses all of these patterns except for one.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\nAs we saw in our earliest conversations with Python, we must communicate very precisely when we write Python code. The smallest deviation or mistake will cause Python to give up looking at your program.\nBeginning programmers often take the fact that Python leaves no room for errors as evidence that Python is mean, hateful, and cruel. While Python seems to like everyone else, Python knows them personally and holds a grudge against them. Because of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly written programs and rejects them as \"unfit\" just to torment us.\n    >>> primt 'Hello world!'\n      File \"\", line 1\n        primt 'Hello world!'\n                           ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>> primt ('Hello world')\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"\", line 1, in \n    NameError: name 'primt' is not defined\n\n    >>> I hate you Python!\n      File \"\", line 1\n        I hate you Python!\n             ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>> if you come out of there, I would teach you a lesson\n      File \"\", line 1\n        if you come out of there, I would teach you a lesson\n                  ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>>\n\nThere is little to be gained by arguing with Python. It is just a tool. It has no emotions and it is happy and ready to serve you whenever you need it. Its error messages sound harsh, but they are just Python's call for help. It has looked at what you typed, and it simply cannot understand what you have entered.\nPython is much more like a dog, loving you unconditionally, having a few key words that it understands, looking you with a sweet look on its face (>>>), and waiting for you to say something it understands. When Python says \"SyntaxError: invalid syntax\", it is simply wagging its tail and saying, \"You seemed to say something but I just don't understand what you meant, but please keep talking to me (>>>).\"\nAs your programs become increasingly sophisticated, you will encounter three general types of errors:\nSyntax errors\nThese are the first errors you will make and the easiest to fix. A syntax error means that you have violated the \"grammar\" rules of Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the program than where Python noticed it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.\nLogic errors\nA logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be, \"take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.\"\nSemantic errors\nA semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you intended for it to do. A simple example would be if you were giving a person directions to a restaurant and said, \"...when you reach the intersection with the gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red building on your left.\" Your friend is very late and calls you to tell you that they are on a farm and walking around behind a barn, with no sign of a restaurant. Then you say \"did you turn left or right at the gas station?\" and they say, \"I followed your directions perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one mile at the gas station.\" Then you say, \"I am very sorry, because while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small but undetected semantic error.\".\nAgain in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest to do exactly what you have asked.\nThe learning journey\nAs you progress through the rest of the book, don't be afraid if the concepts don't seem to fit together well the first time. When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences and took 5-6 more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.\nWe want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don't hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the \"why?\" of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.\nUsually when you are learning your first programming language, there are a few wonderful \"Ah Hah!\" moments where you can look up from pounding away at some rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture.\nIf something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it.\nExercises\nExercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?\na) Execute all of the computation and logic of the programb) Retrieve web pages over the Internetc) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycled) Take input from the user\nExercise 2: What is a program?\nExercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?\nExercise 4: Which of the following contains \"machine code\"?\na) The Python interpreterb) The keyboardc) Python source filed) A word processing document\nExercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:\n    >>> primt 'Hello world!'\n      File \"\", line 1\n        primt 'Hello world!'\n                           ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    >>>\n\nExercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as \"x\" stored after the following Python line finishes?\n    x = 123\n\na) Central processing unitb) Main Memoryc) Secondary Memoryd) Input Devicese) Output Devices\nExercise 7: What will the following program print out:\n    x = 43\n    x = x + 1\n    print(x)\n\na) 43b) 44c) x + 1d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically\nExercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device.

The values we have seen so far are 1, 2, and \"Hello, World!\"\nThese values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and \"Hello, World!\" is a string, so called because it contains a \"string\" of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\nThe print statement also works for integers. We use the python command to start the interpreter.\npython\n>>> print(4)\n4\n\nIf you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.\n>>> type('Hello, World!')\n\n>>> type(17)\n\n\nNot surprisingly, strings belong to the type str and integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float, because these numbers are represented in a format called floating point.\n>>> type(3.2)\n\n\nWhat about values like \"17\" and \"3.2\"? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings.\n>>> type('17')\n\n>>> type('3.2')\n\n\nThey're strings.\nWhen you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:\n>>> print(1,000,000)\n1 0 0\n\nWell, that's not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated sequence of integers, which it prints with spaces between.\nThis is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn't do the \"right\" thing.\nVariables \nOne of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.\nAn assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:\n>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'\n>>> n = 17\n>>> pi = 3.1415926535897931\n\nThis example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named message; the second assigns the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of π to pi.\nTo display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement:\n>>> print(n)\n17\n>>> print(pi)\n3.141592653589793\n\nThe type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.\n>>> type(message)\n\n>>> type(n)\n\n>>> type(pi)\n\n\nVariable names and keywords \nProgrammers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and document what the variable is used for.\nVariable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they cannot start with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll see why later).\nThe underscore character (_) can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow. Variable names can start with an underscore character, but we generally avoid doing this unless we are writing library code for others to use.\nIf you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:\n>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> more@ = 1000000\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number. more@ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @. But what's wrong with class?\nIt turns out that class is one of Python's keywords. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.\nPython reserves 33 keywords:\nand       del       from      None      True\nas        elif      global    nonlocal  try\nassert    else      if        not       while\nbreak     except    import    or        with\nclass     False     in        pass      yield\ncontinue  finally   is        raise\ndef       for       lambda    return\n\nYou might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it is on this list.\nStatements \nA statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignment.\nWhen you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and displays the result, if there is one.\nA script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.\nFor example, the script\nprint(1)\nx = 2\nprint(x)\n\nproduces the output\n1\n2\n\nThe assignment statement produces no output.\nOperators and operands \nOperators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called operands.\nThe operators +, -, *, /, and ** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, as in the following examples:\n20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)\n\nThere has been a change in the division operator between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. In Python 3.x, the result of this division is a floating point result:\n>>> minute = 59\n>>> minute/60\n0.9833333333333333\n\nThe division operator in Python 2.0 would divide two integers and truncate the result to an integer:\n>>> minute = 59\n>>> minute/60\n0\n\nTo obtain the same answer in Python 3.0 use floored ( // integer) division.\n>>> minute = 59\n>>> minute//60\n0\n\nIn Python 3.0 integer division functions much more as you would expect if you entered the expression on a calculator.\nExpressions \nAn expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):\n17\nx\nx + 17\n\nIf you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result:\n>>> 1 + 1\n2\n\nBut in a script, an expression all by itself doesn't do anything! This is a common source of confusion for beginners.\nExercise 1: Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:\n5\nx = 5\nx + 1\n\nOrder of operations \nWhen more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:\n\nParentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 *     (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn't change the result.\nExponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and 3*1**3 is 3, not 27.\nMultiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8.0, not 5.\nOperators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the expression 5-3-1 is 1, not 3, because the 5-3 happens first and then 1 is subtracted from 2.\n\nWhen in doubt, always put parentheses in your expressions to make sure the computations are performed in the order you intend.\nModulus operator \nThe modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (%). The syntax is the same as for other operators:\n>>> quotient = 7 // 3\n>>> print(quotient)\n2\n>>> remainder = 7 % 3\n>>> print(remainder)\n1\n\nSo 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.\nThe modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another: if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y.\nYou can also extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, x % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly, x % 100 yields the last two digits.\nString operations \nThe + operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sense. Instead it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end to end. For example:\n>>> first = 10\n>>> second = 15\n>>> print(first+second)\n25\n>>> first = '100'\n>>> second = '150'\n>>> print(first + second)\n100150\n\nThe output of this program is 100150.\nAsking the user for input \nSometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user via their keyboard. Python provides a built-in function called input that gets input from the keyboard1. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.\n>>> input = input()\nSome silly stuff\n>>> print(input)\nSome silly stuff\n\nBefore getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what to input. You can pass a string to input to be displayed to the user before pausing for input:\n>>> name = input('What is your name?\\n')\nWhat is your name?\nChuck\n>>> print(name)\nChuck\n\nThe sequence \\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special character that causes a line break. That's why the user's input appears below the prompt.\nIf you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to int using the int() function:\n>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\n'\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n17\n>>> int(speed)\n17\n>>> int(speed) + 5\n22\n\nBut if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\nWhat do you mean, an African or a European swallow?\n>>> int(speed)\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:\n\nWe will see how to handle this kind of error later.\nComments \nAs programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.\nFor this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments, and in Python they start with the # symbol:\n# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed\npercentage = (minute * 100) / 60\n\nIn this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line:\npercentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour\n\nEverything from the \\# to the end of the line is ignored; it has no effect on the program.\nComments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out what the code does; it is much more useful to explain why.\nThis comment is redundant with the code and useless:\nv = 5     # assign 5 to v\n\nThis comment contains useful information that is not in the code:\nv = 5     # velocity in meters/second.\n\nGood variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a trade-off.\nChoosing mnemonic variable names \nAs long as you follow the simple rules of variable naming, and avoid reserved words, you have a lot of choice when you name your variables. In the beginning, this choice can be confusing both when you read a program and when you write your own programs. For example, the following three programs are identical in terms of what they accomplish, but very different when you read them and try to understand them.\na = 35.0\nb = 12.50\nc = a * b\nprint(c)\n\nhours = 35.0\nrate = 12.50\npay = hours * rate\nprint(pay)\n\nx1q3z9ahd = 35.0\nx1q3z9afd = 12.50\nx1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ahd * x1q3z9afd\nprint(x1q3p9afd)\n\nThe Python interpreter sees all three of these programs as exactly the same but humans see and understand these programs quite differently. Humans will most quickly understand the intent of the second program because the programmer has chosen variable names that reflect their intent regarding what data will be stored in each variable.\nWe call these wisely chosen variable names \"mnemonic variable names\". The word mnemonic2 means \"memory aid\". We choose mnemonic variable names to help us remember why we created the variable in the first place.\nWhile this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable names, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer's ability to parse and understand code. This is because beginning programmers have not yet memorized the reserved words (there are only 33 of them) and sometimes variables with names that are too descriptive start to look like part of the language and not just well-chosen variable names.\nTake a quick look at the following Python sample code which loops through some data. We will cover loops soon, but for now try to just puzzle through what this means:\nfor word in words:\n    print(word)\n\nWhat is happening here? Which of the tokens (for, word, in, etc.) are reserved words and which are just variable names? Does Python understand at a fundamental level the notion of words? Beginning programmers have trouble separating what parts of the code must be the same as this example and what parts of the code are simply choices made by the programmer.\nThe following code is equivalent to the above code:\nfor slice in pizza:\n    print(slice)\n\nIt is easier for the beginning programmer to look at this code and know which parts are reserved words defined by Python and which parts are simply variable names chosen by the programmer. It is pretty clear that Python has no fundamental understanding of pizza and slices and the fact that a pizza consists of a set of one or more slices.\nBut if our program is truly about reading data and looking for words in the data, pizza and slice are very un-mnemonic variable names. Choosing them as variable names distracts from the meaning of the program.\nAfter a pretty short period of time, you will know the most common reserved words and you will start to see the reserved words jumping out at you:\nword *in* words*:*\\ *print* word\nThe parts of the code that are defined by Python (for, in, print, and :) are in bold and the programmer-chosen variables (word and words) are not in bold. Many text editors are aware of Python syntax and will color reserved words differently to give you clues to keep your variables and reserved words separate. After a while you will begin to read Python and quickly determine what is a variable and what is a reserved word.\nDebugging \nAt this point, the syntax error you are most likely to make is an illegal variable name, like class and yield, which are keywords, or odd~job and US$, which contain illegal characters.\nIf you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two operands without an operator:\n>>> bad name = 5\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n>>> month = 09\n  File \"\", line 1\n    month = 09\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid token\n\nFor syntax errors, the error messages don't help much. The most common messages are SyntaxError: invalid syntax and SyntaxError: invalid token, neither of which is very informative.\nThe runtime error you are most likely to make is a \"use before def;\" that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned a value. This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:\n>>> principal = 327.68\n>>> interest = principle * rate\nNameError: name 'principle' is not defined\n\nVariables names are case sensitive, so LaTeX is not the same as latex.\nAt this point, the most likely cause of a semantic error is the order of operations. For example, to evaluate 1 / 2π, you might be tempted to write\n>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi\n\nBut the division happens first, so you would get π / 2, which is not the same thing! There is no way for Python to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don't get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.\nEnter your name: Chuck\nHello Chuck\n\nExercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.\nEnter Hours: 35\nEnter Rate: 2.75\nPay: 96.25\n\nWe won't worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.\nExercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:\nwidth = 17\nheight = 12.0\n\nFor each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).\n\nwidth//2\nwidth/2.0\nheight/3\n1 + 2 \\* 5\n\nUse the Python interpreter to check your answers.\nExercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.\n\n\n1.

Conditionals","keywords":"","body":"Conditional execution \n\nBoolean expressions\nLogical operators\nConditional execution\nAlternative execution\nChained conditionals\nNested conditionals\nCatching exceptions using try and except\nShort-circuit evaluation of logical expressions\nDebugging\nExercises\n\nBoolean expressions \nA boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples use the operator ==, which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal and False otherwise:\n>>> 5 == 5\nTrue\n>>> 5 == 6\nFalse\n{}\n\nTrue and False are special values that belong to the class bool; they are not strings:\n>>> type(True)\n\n>>> type(False)\n\n\nThe == operator is one of the comparison operators; the others are:\n      x != y               # x is not equal to y\n      x > y                # x is greater than y\n      x = y               # x is greater than or equal to y\n      x \nAlthough these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols for the same operations. A common error is to use a single equal sign (=) instead of a double equal sign (==). Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a comparison operator. There is no such thing as = or =>.\nLogical operators \nThere are three logical operators: and, or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,\nx > 0 and x \nis true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or 3.\nFinally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is false; that is, if x is less than or equal to y.\nStrictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as \"true.\"\n>>> 17 and True\nTrue\n\nThis flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it until you are sure you know what you are doing.\nConditional execution \nIn order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this ability. The simplest form is the if statement:\nif x > 0 :\n    print('x is positive')\n\nThe boolean expression after the if statement is called the condition. We end the if statement with a colon character (:) and the line(s) after the if statement are indented.\nImagen - If logic\nIf the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If the logical condition is false, the indented statement is skipped.\nif statements have the same structure as function definitions or for loops1. The statement consists of a header line that ends with the colon character (:) followed by an indented block. Statements like this are called compound statements because they stretch across more than one line.\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there must be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a place holder for code you haven't written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement, which does nothing.\nif x \nIf you enter an if statement in the Python interpreter, the prompt will change from three chevrons to three dots to indicate you are in the middle of a block of statements, as shown below:\n>>> x = 3\n>>> if x >>\n\nAlternative execution \nA second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this:\nif x%2 == 0 :\n    print('x is even')\nelse :\n    print('x is odd')\n\nIf the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is even, and the program displays a message to that effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is executed.\nImagen - If-Then-Else Logic\nSince the condition must either be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be executed. The alternatives are called branches, because they are branches in the flow of execution.\nChained conditionals \nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:\nif x  y:\n    print('x is greater than y')\nelse:\n    print('x and y are equal')\n\nelif is an abbreviation of \"else if.\" Again, exactly one branch will be executed.\nImagen - If-Then-ElseIf Logic\nThere is no limit on the number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn't have to be one.\nif choice == 'a':\n    print('Bad guess')\nelif choice == 'b':\n    print('Good guess')\nelif choice == 'c':\n    print('Close, but not correct')\n\nEach condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes.\nNested conditionals \nOne conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the three-branch example like this:\nif x == y:\n    print('x and y are equal')\nelse:\n    if x \nThe outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch contains a simple statement. The second branch contains another if statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional statements as well.\nImagen - Nested If Statements\nAlthough the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested conditionals become difficult to read very quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.\nLogical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:\nif 0 \nThe print statement is executed only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the and operator:\nif 0 \nCatching exceptions using try and except \nEarlier we saw a code segment where we used the input and int functions to read and parse an integer number entered by the user. We also saw how treacherous doing this could be:\n>>> prompt = \"What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\n\"\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\nWhat do you mean, an African or a European swallow?\n>>> int(speed)\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:\n>>>\n\nWhen we are executing these statements in the Python interpreter, we get a new prompt from the interpreter, think \"oops\", and move on to our next statement.\nHowever if you place this code in a Python script and this error occurs, your script immediately stops in its tracks with a traceback. It does not execute the following statement.\nHere is a sample program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius temperature:\n\n\nIf we execute this code and give it invalid input, it simply fails with an unfriendly error message:\npython fahren.py\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:72\n22.22222222222222\n\npython fahren.py\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"fahren.py\", line 2, in \n    fahr = float(inp)\nValueError: could not convert string to float: 'fred'\n\nThere is a conditional execution structure built into Python to handle these types of expected and unexpected errors called \"try / except\". The idea of try and except is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem and you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error.\nYou can think of the try and except feature in Python as an \"insurance policy\" on a sequence of statements.\nWe can rewrite our temperature converter as follows:\n\n\nPython starts by executing the sequence of statements in the try block. If all goes well, it skips the except block and proceeds. If an exception occurs in the try block, Python jumps out of the try block and executes the sequence of statements in the except block.\npython fahren2.py\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:72\n22.22222222222222\n\npython fahren2.py\nEnter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred\nPlease enter a number\n\nHandling an exception with a try statement is called catching an exception. In this example, the except clause prints an error message. In general, catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the program gracefully.\nShort-circuit evaluation of logical expressions \nWhen Python is processing a logical expression such as x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2, it evaluates the expression from left to right. Because of the definition of and, if x is less than 2, the expression x >= 2 is False and so the whole expression is False regardless of whether (x/y) > 2 evaluates to True or False.\nWhen Python detects that there is nothing to be gained by evaluating the rest of a logical expression, it stops its evaluation and does not do the computations in the rest of the logical expression. When the evaluation of a logical expression stops because the overall value is already known, it is called short-circuiting the evaluation.\nWhile this may seem like a fine point, the short-circuit behavior leads to a clever technique called the guardian pattern. Consider the following code sequence in the Python interpreter:\n>>> x = 6\n>>> y = 2\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nTrue\n>>> x = 1\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nFalse\n>>> x = 6\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n>>>\n\nThe third calculation failed because Python was evaluating (x/y) and y was zero, which causes a runtime error. But the second example did not fail because the first part of the expression x >= 2 evaluated to False so the (x/y) was not ever executed due to the short-circuit rule and there was no error.\nWe can construct the logical expression to strategically place a guard evaluation just before the evaluation that might cause an error as follows:\n>>> x = 1\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2\nFalse\n>>> x = 6\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2\nFalse\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2 and y != 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n>>>\n\nIn the first logical expression, x >= 2 is False so the evaluation stops at the and. In the second logical expression, x >= 2 is True but y != 0 is False so we never reach (x/y).\nIn the third logical expression, the y != 0 is after the (x/y) calculation so the expression fails with an error.\nIn the second expression, we say that y != 0 acts as a guard to insure that we only execute (x/y) if y is non-zero.\nDebugging \nThe traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually:\n\nWhat kind of error it was, and\nWhere it occurred.\n\nSyntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas. Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.\n>>> x = 5\n>>>  y = 6\n  File \"\", line 1\n    y = 6\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIn this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one space. But the error message points to y, which is misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a previous line.\nIn general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, but that is often not where it was caused.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.\nEnter Hours: 45\nEnter Rate: 10\nPay: 475.0\n\nExercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:\nEnter Hours: 20\nEnter Rate: nine\nError, please enter numeric input\n\nEnter Hours: forty\nError, please enter numeric input\n\nExercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:\nScore   Grade\n>= 0.9     A\n>= 0.8     B\n>= 0.7     C\n>= 0.6     D\n\nEnter score: 0.95 A ~~\nEnter score: perfect\nBad score\n\nEnter score: 10.0\nBad score\n\nEnter score: 0.75\nC\n\nEnter score: 0.5\nF\n\nRun the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various different values for input.\n\n\n1.

When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can \"call\" the function by name. We have already seen one example of a function call:\n>>> type(32)\n\n\nThe name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The argument is a value or variable that we are passing into the function as input to the function. The result, for the type function, is the type of the argument.\nIt is common to say that a function \"takes\" an argument and \"returns\" a result. The result is called the return value.\nBuilt-in functions \nPython provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without needing to provide the function definition. The creators of Python wrote a set of functions to solve common problems and included them in Python for us to use.\nThe max and min functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively:\n>>> max('Hello world')\n'w'\n>>> min('Hello world')\n' '\n>>>\n\nThe max function tells us the \"largest character\" in the string (which turns out to be the letter \"w\") and the min function shows us the smallest character (which turns out to be a space).\nAnother very common built-in function is the len function which tells us how many items are in its argument. If the argument to len is a string, it returns the number of characters in the string.\n>>> len('Hello world')\n11\n>>>\n\nThese functions are not limited to looking at strings. They can operate on any set of values, as we will see in later chapters.\nYou should treat the names of built-in functions as reserved words (i.e., avoid using \"max\" as a variable name).\nType conversion functions \nPython also provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:\n>>> int('32')\n32\n>>> int('Hello')\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hello'\n\nint can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part:\n>>> int(3.99999)\n3\n>>> int(-2.3)\n-2\n\nfloat converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:\n>>> float(32)\n32.0\n>>> float('3.14159')\n3.14159\n\nFinally, str converts its argument to a string:\n>>> str(32)\n'32'\n>>> str(3.14159)\n'3.14159'\n\nRandom numbers \nGiven the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs every time, so they are said to be deterministic. Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but there are more.\nMaking a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy, but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is to use algorithms that generate pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.\nThe random module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call \"random\" from here on).\nThe function random returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call random, you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run this loop:\nimport random\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    x = random.random()\n    print(x)\n\nThis program produces the following list of 10 random numbers between 0.0 and up to but not including 1.0.\n0.11132867921152356\n0.5950949227890241\n0.04820265884996877\n0.841003109276478\n0.997914947094958\n0.04842330803368111\n0.7416295948208405\n0.510535245390327\n0.27447040171978143\n0.028511805472785867\n\nExercise 1: Run the program on your system and see what numbers you get. Run the program more than once and see what numbers you get.\nThe random function is only one of many functions that handle random numbers. The function randint takes the parameters low and high, and returns an integer between low and high (including both).\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\n5\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\n9\n\nTo choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice:\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> random.choice(t)\n2\n>>> random.choice(t)\n3\n\nThe random module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.\nMath functions \nPython has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. Before we can use the module, we have to import it:\n>>> import math\n\nThis statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module object, you get some information about it:\n>>> print(math)\n\n\nThe module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation.\n>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\n>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\n\n>>> radians = 0.7\n>>> height = math.sin(radians)\n\nThe first example computes the logarithm base 10 of the signal-to-noise ratio. The math module also provides a function called log that computes logarithms base e.\nThe second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2π:\n>>> degrees = 45\n>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi\n>>> math.sin(radians)\n0.7071067811865476\n\nThe expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits.\nIf you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two divided by two:\n>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0\n0.7071067811865476\n\nAdding new functions \nSo far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. Once we define a function, we can reuse the function over and over throughout our program.\nHere is an example:\ndef print_lyrics():\n    print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n    print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')\n\ndef is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can't be a number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.\nThe empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn't take any arguments. Later we will build functions that take arguments as their inputs.\nThe first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.\nThe strings in the print statements are enclosed in quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.\nIf you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses (...) to let you know that the definition isn't complete:\n>>> def print_lyrics():\n...     print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n...     print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')\n...\n\nTo end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script).\nDefining a function creates a variable with the same name.\n>>> print(print_lyrics)\n\n>>> print(type(print_lyrics))\n\n\nThe value of print_lyrics is a function object, which has type \"function\".\nThe syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:\n>>> print_lyrics()\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\n\nOnce you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics:\ndef repeat_lyrics():\n    print_lyrics()\n    print_lyrics()\n\nAnd then call repeat_lyrics:\n>>> repeat_lyrics()\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\n\nBut that's not really how the song goes.\nDefinitions and uses \nPulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:\n\n\nThis program contains two function definitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics. Function definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and the function definition generates no output.\nAs you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called.\nExercise 2: Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.\nExercise 3: Move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics. What happens when you run this program?\nFlow of execution \nIn order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the flow of execution.\nExecution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.\nFunction definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.\nA function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.\nThat sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!\nFortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.\nWhat's the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don't always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.\nParameters and arguments \nSome of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.\nInside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters. Here is an example of a user-defined function that takes an argument:\ndef print_twice(bruce):\n    print(bruce)\n    print(bruce)\n\nThis function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce. When the function is called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.\nThis function works with any value that can be printed.\n>>> print_twice('Spam')\nSpam\nSpam\n>>> print_twice(17)\n17\n17\n>>> import math\n>>> print_twice(math.pi)\n3.141592653589793\n3.141592653589793\n\nThe same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument for print_twice:\n>>> print_twice('Spam '*4)\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\n>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))\n-1.0\n-1.0\n\nThe argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions \"Spam '*4andmath.cos(math.pi)` are only evaluated once.\nYou can also use a variable as an argument:\n>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'\n>>> print_twice(michael)\nEric, the half a bee.\nEric, the half a bee.\n\nThe name of the variable we pass as an argument (michael) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (bruce). It doesn't matter what the value was called back home (in the caller); here in print_twice, we call everybody bruce.\nFruitful functions and void functions \nSome of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results; for lack of a better name, I call them fruitful functions. Other functions, like print_twice, perform an action but don't return a value. They are called void functions.\nWhen you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:\nx = math.cos(radians)\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\n\nWhen you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\n>>> math.sqrt(5)\n2.23606797749979\n\nBut in a script, if you call a fruitful function and do not store the result of the function in a variable, the return value vanishes into the mist!\nmath.sqrt(5)\n\nThis script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn't store the result in a variable or display the result, it is not very useful.\nVoid functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don't have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called None.\n>>> result = print_twice('Bing')\nBing\nBing\n>>> print(result)\nNone\n\nThe value None is not the same as the string \"None\". It is a special value that has its own type:\n>>> print(type(None))\n\n\nTo return a result from a function, we use the return statement in our function. For example, we could make a very simple function called addtwo that adds two numbers together and returns a result.\n\n\nWhen this script executes, the print statement will print out \"8\" because the addtwo function was called with 3 and 5 as arguments. Within the function, the parameters a and b were 3 and 5 respectively. The function computed the sum of the two numbers and placed it in the local function variable named added. Then it used the return statement to send the computed value back to the calling code as the function result, which was assigned to the variable x and printed out.\nWhy functions? \nIt may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n\nCreating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\nFunctions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\nDividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\nWell-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n\nThroughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as \"find the smallest value in a list of values\". Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list.\nDebugging \nIf you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with spaces and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most text editors that know about Python do this by default, but some don't.\nTabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation for you.\nAlso, don't forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environments do this automatically, but some don't. In that case, the program you are looking at in the text editor is not the same as the program you are running.\nDebugging can take a long time if you keep running the same incorrect program over and over!\nMake sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running. If you're not sure, put something like print(\"hello\") at the beginning of the program and run it again. If you don't see hello, you're not running the right program!\nExercises \nExercise 4: What is the purpose of the \"def\" keyword in Python?\na) It is slang that means \"the following code is really cool\"b) It indicates the start of a functionc) It indicates that the following indented section of code is to be stored for laterd) b and c are both truee) None of the above\nExercise 5: What will the following Python program print out?\ndef fred():\n   print(\"Zap\")\n\ndef jane():\n   print(\"ABC\")\n\njane()\nfred()\njane()\n\na) Zap ABC jane fred janeb) Zap ABC Zapc) ABC Zap janed) ABC Zap ABCe) Zap Zap Zap\nExercise 6: Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate).\nEnter Hours: 45\nEnter Rate: 10\nPay: 475.0\n\nExercise 7: Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.\nScore   Grade\n> 0.9     A\n> 0.8     B\n> 0.7     C\n> 0.6     D\n\nProgram Execution:\n\nEnter score: 0.95\nA\n\nEnter score: perfect\nBad score\n\nEnter score: 10.0\nBad score\n\nEnter score: 0.75\nC\n\nEnter score: 0.5\nF\n\nRun the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input.\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

Iterations","keywords":"","body":"Iteration \n\nUpdating variables\nThe while statement\nInfinite loops\n\"Infinite loops\" and break\nFinishing iterations with continue\nDefinite loops using for\nLoop patterns\nCounting and summing loops\nMaximum and minimum loops\nDebugging\nExercises\n\nUpdating variables \nA common pattern in assignment statements is an assignment statement that updates a variable, where the new value of the variable depends on the old.\nx = x + 1\n\nThis means \"get the current value of x, add 1, and then update x with the new value.\"\nIf you try to update a variable that doesn't exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns a value to x:\n>>> x = x + 1\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined\n\nBefore you can update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assignment:\n>>> x = 0\n>>> x = x + 1\n\nUpdating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment; subtracting 1 is called a decrement.\nThe while statement \nComputers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.\nOne form of iteration in Python is the while statement. Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says \"Blastoff!\".\nn = 5\nwhile n > 0:\n    print(n)\n    n = n - 1\nprint('Blastoff!')\n\nYou can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, \"While n is greater than 0, display the value of n and then reduce the value of n by 1. When you get to 0, exit the while statement and display the word Blastoff!\"\nMore formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:\n\nEvaluate the condition, yielding True or False.\nIf the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.\nIf the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.\n\nThis type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body of the loop an iteration. For the above loop, we would say, \"It had five iterations\", which means that the body of the loop was executed five times.\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes the iteration variable. If there is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an infinite loop.\nInfinite loops \nAn endless source of amusement for programmers is the observation that the directions on shampoo, \"Lather, rinse, repeat,\" are an infinite loop because there is no iteration variable telling you how many times to execute the loop.\nIn the case of countdown, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the value of n is finite, and we can see that the value of n gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. Other times a loop is obviously infinite because it has no iteration variable at all.\n\"Infinite loops\" and break \nSometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can write an infinite loop on purpose and then use the break statement to jump out of the loop.\nThis loop is obviously an infinite loop because the logical expression on the while statement is simply the logical constant True:\nn = 10\nwhile True:\n    print(n, end=' ')\n    n = n - 1\nprint('Done!')\n\nIf you make the mistake and run this code, you will learn quickly how to stop a runaway Python process on your system or find where the power-off button is on your computer. This program will run forever or until your battery runs out because the logical expression at the top of the loop is always true by virtue of the fact that the expression is the constant value True.\nWhile this is a dysfunctional infinite loop, we can still use this pattern to build useful loops as long as we carefully add code to the body of the loop to explicitly exit the loop using break when we have reached the exit condition.\nFor example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type done. You could write:\n\n\nThe loop condition is True, which is always true, so the loop runs repeatedly until it hits the break statement.\nEach time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types done, the break statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here's a sample run:\n> hello there\nhello there\n> finished\nfinished\n> done\nDone!\n\nThis way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (\"stop when this happens\") rather than negatively (\"keep going until that happens.\").\nFinishing iterations with continue \nSometimes you are in an iteration of a loop and want to finish the current iteration and immediately jump to the next iteration. In that case you can use the continue statement to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration.\nHere is an example of a loop that copies its input until the user types \"done\", but treats lines that start with the hash character as lines not to be printed (kind of like Python comments).\n\n\nHere is a sample run of this new program with continue added.\n> hello there\nhello there\n> # don't print this\n> print this!\nprint this!\n> done\nDone!\n\nAll the lines are printed except the one that starts with the hash sign because when the continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to the while statement to start the next iteration, thus skipping the print statement.\nDefinite loops using for \nSometimes we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a definite loop using a for statement. We call the while statement an indefinite loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes False, whereas the for loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.\nThe syntax of a for loop is similar to the while loop in that there is a for statement and a loop body:\nfriends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']\nfor friend in friends:\n    print('Happy New Year:', friend)\nprint('Done!')\n\nIn Python terms, the variable friends is a list1 of three strings and the for loop goes through the list and executes the body once for each of the three strings in the list resulting in this output:\nHappy New Year: Joseph\nHappy New Year: Glenn\nHappy New Year: Sally\nDone!\n\nTranslating this for loop to English is not as direct as the while, but if you think of friends as a set, it goes like this: \"Run the statements in the body of the for loop once for each friend in the set named friends.\"\nLooking at the for loop, for and in are reserved Python keywords, and friend and friends are variables.\nfor friend in friends:\n    print('Happy New Year:', friend)\n\nIn particular, friend is the iteration variable for the for loop. The variable friend changes for each iteration of the loop and controls when the for loop completes. The iteration variable steps successively through the three strings stored in the friends variable.\nLoop patterns \nOften we use a for or while loop to go through a list of items or the contents of a file and we are looking for something such as the largest or smallest value of the data we scan through.\nThese loops are generally constructed by:\n\nInitializing one or more variables before the loop starts\nPerforming some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly changing the variables in the body of the loop\nLooking at the resulting variables when the loop completes\n\nWe will use a list of numbers to demonstrate the concepts and construction of these loop patterns.\nCounting and summing loops \nFor example, to count the number of items in a list, we would write the following for loop:\ncount = 0\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\n    count = count + 1\nprint('Count: ', count)\n\nWe set the variable count to zero before the loop starts, then we write a for loop to run through the list of numbers. Our iteration variable is named itervar and while we do not use itervar in the loop, it does control the loop and cause the loop body to be executed once for each of the values in the list.\nIn the body of the loop, we add 1 to the current value of count for each of the values in the list. While the loop is executing, the value of count is the number of values we have seen \"so far\".\nOnce the loop completes, the value of count is the total number of items. The total number \"falls in our lap\" at the end of the loop. We construct the loop so that we have what we want when the loop finishes.\nAnother similar loop that computes the total of a set of numbers is as follows:\ntotal = 0\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\n    total = total + itervar\nprint('Total: ', total)\n\nIn this loop we do use the iteration variable. Instead of simply adding one to the count as in the previous loop, we add the actual number (3, 41, 12, etc.) to the running total during each loop iteration. If you think about the variable total, it contains the \"running total of the values so far\". So before the loop starts total is zero because we have not yet seen any values, during the loop total is the running total, and at the end of the loop total is the overall total of all the values in the list.\nAs the loop executes, total accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an accumulator.\nNeither the counting loop nor the summing loop are particularly useful in practice because there are built-in functions len() and sum() that compute the number of items in a list and the total of the items in the list respectively.\nMaximum and minimum loops \nTo find the largest value in a list or sequence, we construct the following loop:\nlargest = None\nprint('Before:', largest)\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\n    if largest is None or itervar > largest :\n        largest = itervar\n    print('Loop:', itervar, largest)\nprint('Largest:', largest)\n\nWhen the program executes, the output is as follows:\nBefore: None\nLoop: 3 3\nLoop: 41 41\nLoop: 12 41\nLoop: 9 41\nLoop: 74 74\nLoop: 15 74\nLargest: 74\n\nThe variable largest is best thought of as the \"largest value we have seen so far\". Before the loop, we set largest to the constant None. None is a special constant value which we can store in a variable to mark the variable as \"empty\".\nBefore the loop starts, the largest value we have seen so far is None since we have not yet seen any values. While the loop is executing, if largest is None then we take the first value we see as the largest so far. You can see in the first iteration when the value of itervar is 3, since largest is None, we immediately set largest to be 3.\nAfter the first iteration, largest is no longer None, so the second part of the compound logical expression that checks itervar > largest triggers only when we see a value that is larger than the \"largest so far\". When we see a new \"even larger\" value we take that new value for largest. You can see in the program output that largest progresses from 3 to 41 to 74.\nAt the end of the loop, we have scanned all of the values and the variable largest now does contain the largest value in the list.\nTo compute the smallest number, the code is very similar with one small change:\nsmallest = None\nprint('Before:', smallest)\nfor itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:\n    if smallest is None or itervar \nAgain, smallest is the \"smallest so far\" before, during, and after the loop executes. When the loop has completed, smallest contains the minimum value in the list.\nAgain as in counting and summing, the built-in functions max() and min() make writing these exact loops unnecessary.\nThe following is a simple version of the Python built-in min() function:\ndef min(values):\n    smallest = None\n    for value in values:\n        if smallest is None or value \nIn the function version of the smallest code, we removed all of the print statements so as to be equivalent to the min function which is already built in to Python.\nDebugging \nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debugging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide.\nOne way to cut your debugging time is \"debugging by bisection.\" For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, the problem must be in the first half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. After six steps (which is much less than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory.\nIn practice it is not always clear what the \"middle of the program\" is and not always possible to check it. It doesn't make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters \"done\". Once \"done\" is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.\nEnter a number: 4\nEnter a number: 5\nEnter a number: bad data\nInvalid input\nEnter a number: 7\nEnter a number: done\n16 3 5.333333333333333\n\nExercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.\n\n\n1. We will examine lists in more detail in a later chapter. ↩\n\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

But in Python, the index is an offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.\n>>> letter = fruit[0]\n>>> print(letter)\nb\n\nSo b is the 0th letter (\"zero-eth\") of \"banana\", a is the 1th letter (\"one-eth\"), and n is the 2th (\"two-eth\") letter.\nImagen - String Indexes\nYou can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an index, but the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you get:\n>>> letter = fruit[1.5]\nTypeError: string indices must be integers\n\nGetting the length of a string using len \nlen is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:\n>>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> len(fruit)\n6\n\nTo get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:\n>>> length = len(fruit)\n>>> last = fruit[length]\nIndexError: string index out of range\n\nThe reason for the IndexError is that there is no letter in 'banana' with the index 6. Since we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from length:\n>>> last = fruit[length-1]\n>>> print(last)\na\n\nAlternatively, you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The expression fruit[-1] yields the last letter, fruit[-2] yields the second to last, and so on.\nTraversal through a string with a loop \nA lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a traversal. One way to write a traversal is with a while loop:\nindex = 0\nwhile index \nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition is index \\, so when index is equal to the length of the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed. The last character accessed is the one with the index len(fruit)-1, which is the last character in the string.\nExercise 1: Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.\nAnother way to write a traversal is with a for loop:\nfor char in fruit:\n    print(char)\n\nEach time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable char. The loop continues until no characters are left.\nString slices \nA segment of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:\n>>> s = 'Monty Python'\n>>> print(s[0:5])\nMonty\n>>> print(s[6:12])\nPython\n\nThe operator returns the part of the string from the \"n-eth\" character to the \"m-eth\" character, including the first but excluding the last.\nIf you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:\n>>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> fruit[:3]\n'ban'\n>>> fruit[3:]\n'ana'\n\nIf the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an empty string, represented by two quotation marks:\n>>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> fruit[3:3]\n''\n\nAn empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it is the same as any other string.\nExercise 2: Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?\nStrings are immutable \nIt is tempting to use the operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string. For example:\n>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'\n>>> greeting[0] = 'J'\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\nThe \"object\" in this case is the string and the \"item\" is the character you tried to assign. For now, an object is the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition later. An item is one of the values in a sequence.\nThe reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you can't change an existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:\n>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'\n>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]\n>>> print(new_greeting)\nJello, world!\n\nThis example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of greeting. It has no effect on the original string.\nLooping and counting \nThe following program counts the number of times the letter a appears in a string:\nword = 'banana'\ncount = 0\nfor letter in word:\n    if letter == 'a':\n        count = count + 1\nprint(count)\n\nThis program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a counter. The variable count is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an a is found. When the loop exits, count contains the result: the total number of a's.\nExercise 3:\nEncapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.\nThe in operator \nThe word in is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns True if the first appears as a substring in the second:\n>>> 'a' in 'banana'\nTrue\n>>> 'seed' in 'banana'\nFalse\n\nString comparison \nThe comparison operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:\nif word == 'banana':\n    print('All right, bananas.')\n\nOther comparison operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order:\nif word  'banana':\n    print('Your word,' + word + ', comes after banana.')\nelse:\n    print('All right, bananas.')\n\nPython does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way that people do. All the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters, so:\nYour word, Pineapple, comes before banana.\n\nA common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple.\nstring methods \nStrings are an example of Python objects. An object contains both data (the actual string itself) and methods, which are effectively functions that are built into the object and are available to any instance of the object.\nPython has a function called dir which lists the methods available for an object. The type function shows the type of an object and the dir function shows the available methods.\n>>> stuff = 'Hello world'\n>>> type(stuff)\n\n>>> dir(stuff)\n['capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode',\n'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map',\n'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit',\n'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable',\n'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower',\n'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind',\n'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip',\n'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase',\n'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\n>>> help(str.capitalize)\nHelp on method_descriptor:\n\ncapitalize(...)\n    S.capitalize() -> str\n\n    Return a capitalized version of S, i.e. make the first character\n    have upper case and the rest lower case.\n>>>\n\nWhile the dir function lists the methods, and you can use help to get some simple documentation on a method, a better source of documentation for string methods would be https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\nCalling a method is similar to calling a function (it takes arguments and returns a value) but the syntax is different. We call a method by appending the method name to the variable name using the period as a delimiter.\nFor example, the method upper takes a string and returns a new string with all uppercase letters:\nInstead of the function syntax upper(word), it uses the method syntax word.upper().\n>>> word = 'banana'\n>>> new_word = word.upper()\n>>> print(new_word)\nBANANA\n\nThis form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, upper, and the name of the string to apply the method to, word. The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no argument.\nA method call is called an invocation; in this case, we would say that we are invoking upper on the word.\nFor example, there is a string method named find that searches for the position of one string within another:\n>>> word = 'banana'\n>>> index = word.find('a')\n>>> print(index)\n1\n\nIn this example, we invoke find on word and pass the letter we are looking for as a parameter.\nThe find method can find substrings as well as characters:\n>>> word.find('na')\n2\n\nIt can take as a second argument the index where it should start:\n>>> word.find('na', 3)\n4\n\nOne common task is to remove white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) from the beginning and end of a string using the strip method:\n>>> line = '  Here we go  '\n>>> line.strip()\n'Here we go'\n\nSome methods such as startswith return boolean values.\n>>> line = 'Have a nice day'\n>>> line.startswith('Have')\nTrue\n>>> line.startswith('h')\nFalse\n\nYou will note that startswith requires case to match, so sometimes we take a line and map it all to lowercase before we do any checking using the lower method.\n>>> line = 'Have a nice day'\n>>> line.startswith('h')\nFalse\n>>> line.lower()\n'have a nice day'\n>>> line.lower().startswith('h')\nTrue\n\nIn the last example, the method lower is called and then we use startswith to see if the resulting lowercase string starts with the letter \"h\". As long as we are careful with the order, we can make multiple method calls in a single expression.\nExercise 4:\nThere is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods and write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in \"banana\".\nParsing strings \nOften, we want to look into a string and find a substring. For example if we were presented a series of lines formatted as follows:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\nand we wanted to pull out only the second half of the address (i.e., uct.ac.za) from each line, we can do this by using the find method and string slicing.\nFirst, we will find the position of the at-sign in the string. Then we will find the position of the first space after the at-sign. And then we will use string slicing to extract the portion of the string which we are looking for.\n>>> data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'\n>>> atpos = data.find('@')\n>>> print(atpos)\n21\n>>> sppos = data.find(' ',atpos)\n>>> print(sppos)\n31\n>>> host = data[atpos+1:sppos]\n>>> print(host)\nuct.ac.za\n>>>\n\nWe use a version of the find method which allows us to specify a position in the string where we want find to start looking. When we slice, we extract the characters from \"one beyond the at-sign through up to but not including the space character\".\nThe documentation for the find method is available at\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\nFormat operator \nThe format operator, % allows us to construct strings, replacing parts of the strings with the data stored in variables. When applied to integers, % is the modulus operator. But when the first operand is a string, % is the format operator.\nThe first operand is the format string, which contains one or more format sequences that specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string.\nFor example, the format sequence \"%d\" means that the second operand should be formatted as an integer (d stands for \"decimal\"):\n>>> camels = 42\n>>> '%d' % camels\n'42'\n\nThe result is the string \"42\", which is not to be confused with the integer value 42.\nA format sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a sentence:\n>>> camels = 42\n>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels\n'I have spotted 42 camels.'\n\nIf there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a tuple1. Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.\nThe following example uses \"%d\" to format an integer, \"%g\" to format a floating-point number (don't ask why), and \"%s\" to format a string:\n>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')\n'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'\n\nThe number of elements in the tuple must match the number of format sequences in the string. The types of the elements also must match the format sequences:\n>>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)\nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string\n>>> '%d' % 'dollars'\nTypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str\n\nIn the first example, there aren't enough elements; in the second, the element is the wrong type.\nThe format operator is powerful, but it can be difficult to use. You can read more about it at\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting.\nDebugging \nA skill that you should cultivate as you program is always asking yourself, \"What could go wrong here?\" or alternatively, \"What crazy thing might our user do to crash our (seemingly) perfect program?\"\nFor example, look at the program which we used to demonstrate the while loop in the chapter on iteration:\n\n\nLook what happens when the user enters an empty line of input:\n> hello there\nhello there\n> # don't print this\n> print this!\nprint this!\n>\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"copytildone.py\", line 3, in \n    if line[0] == '#':\nIndexError: string index out of range\n\nThe code works fine until it is presented an empty line. Then there is no zero-th character, so we get a traceback. There are two solutions to this to make line three \"safe\" even if the line is empty.\nOne possibility is to simply use the startswith method which returns False if the string is empty.\n    if line.startswith('#'):\n\nAnother way is to safely write the if statement using the guardian pattern and make sure the second logical expression is evaluated only where there is at least one character in the string.:\n    if len(line) > 0 and line[0] == '#':\n\nExercises \nExercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:`\nstr = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'\nUse find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.\nExercise 6:\nRead the documentation of the string methods at\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods\nYou might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.\nThe documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.\n\n\n1. A tuple is a sequence of comma-separated values inside a pair of parenthesis.

Files","keywords":"","body":"Files \n\nPersistence\nOpening files\nText files and lines\nReading files\nSearching through a file\nLetting the user choose the file name\nUsing try, except, and open\nWriting files\nDebugging\nExercises\n\nPersistence \nSo far, we have learned how to write programs and communicate our intentions to the Central Processing Unit using conditional execution, functions, and iterations. We have learned how to create and use data structures in the Main Memory. The CPU and memory are where our software works and runs. It is where all of the \"thinking\" happens.\nBut if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the power is turned off, anything stored in either the CPU or main memory is erased. So up to now, our programs have just been transient fun exercises to learn Python.\nImagen - Secondary memory\nIn this chapter, we start to work with Secondary Memory (or files). Secondary memory is not erased when the power is turned off. Or in the case of a USB flash drive, the data we write from our programs can be removed from the system and transported to another system.\nWe will primarily focus on reading and writing text files such as those we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work with database files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read and written through database software.\nOpening files \nWhen we want to read or write a file (say on your hard drive), we first must open the file. Opening the file communicates with your operating system, which knows where the data for each file is stored. When you open a file, you are asking the operating system to find the file by name and make sure the file exists. In this example, we open the file mbox.txt, which should be stored in the same folder that you are in when you start Python. You can download this file from www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt\n>>> fhand = open('mbox.txt')\n>>> print(fhand)\n\n\nIf the open is successful, the operating system returns us a file handle. The file handle is not the actual data contained in the file, but instead it is a \"handle\" that we can use to read the data. You are given a handle if the requested file exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.\nImagen - A File Handle\nIf the file does not exist, open will fail with a traceback and you will not get a handle to access the contents of the file:\n>>> fhand = open('stuff.txt')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'stuff.txt'\n\nLater we will use try and except to deal more gracefully with the situation where we attempt to open a file that does not exist.\nText files and lines \nA text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines, much like a Python string can be thought of as a sequence of characters. For example, this is a sample of a text file which records mail activity from various individuals in an open source project development team:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\nReturn-Path: \nDate: Sat, 5 Jan 2008 09:12:18 -0500\nTo: source@collab.sakaiproject.org\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nSubject: [sakai] svn commit: r39772 - content/branches/\nDetails: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/?view=rev&amp;rev=39772\n...\n\nThe entire file of mail interactions is available from\nwww.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt\nand a shortened version of the file is available from\nwww.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt\nThese files are in a standard format for a file containing multiple mail messages. The lines which start with \"From \" separate the messages and the lines which start with \"From:\" are part of the messages. For more information about the mbox format, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox.\nTo break the file into lines, there is a special character that represents the \"end of the line\" called the newline character.\nIn Python, we represent the newline character as a backslash-n in string constants. Even though this looks like two characters, it is actually a single character. When we look at the variable by entering \"stuff\" in the interpreter, it shows us the \\n in the string, but when we use print to show the string, we see the string broken into two lines by the newline character.\n>>> stuff = 'Hello\\nWorld!'\n>>> stuff\n'Hello\\nWorld!'\n>>> print(stuff)\nHello\nWorld!\n>>> stuff = 'X\\nY'\n>>> print(stuff)\nX\nY\n>>> len(stuff)\n3\n\nYou can also see that the length of the string X\\nY is three characters because the newline character is a single character.\nSo when we look at the lines in a file, we need to imagine that there is a special invisible character called the newline at the end of each line that marks the end of the line.\nSo the newline character separates the characters in the file into lines.\nReading files \nWhile the file handle does not contain the data for the file, it is quite easy to construct a for loop to read through and count each of the lines in a file:\n\n\nWe can use the file handle as the sequence in our for loop. Our for loop simply counts the number of lines in the file and prints them out. The rough translation of the for loop into English is, \"for each line in the file represented by the file handle, add one to the count variable.\"\nThe reason that the open function does not read the entire file is that the file might be quite large with many gigabytes of data. The open statement takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the file. The for loop actually causes the data to be read from the file.\nWhen the file is read using a for loop in this manner, Python takes care of splitting the data in the file into separate lines using the newline character. Python reads each line through the newline and includes the newline as the last character in the line variable for each iteration of the for loop.\nBecause the for loop reads the data one line at a time, it can efficiently read and count the lines in very large files without running out of main memory to store the data. The above program can count the lines in any size file using very little memory since each line is read, counted, and then discarded.\nIf you know the file is relatively small compared to the size of your main memory, you can read the whole file into one string using the read method on the file handle.\n>>> fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\n>>> inp = fhand.read()\n>>> print(len(inp))\n94626\n>>> print(inp[:20])\nFrom stephen.marquar\n\nIn this example, the entire contents (all 94,626 characters) of the file mbox-short.txt are read directly into the variable inp. We use string slicing to print out the first 20 characters of the string data stored in inp.\nWhen the file is read in this manner, all the characters including all of the lines and newline characters are one big string in the variable inp. Remember that this form of the open function should only be used if the file data will fit comfortably in the main memory of your computer.\nIf the file is too large to fit in main memory, you should write your program to read the file in chunks using a for or while loop.\nSearching through a file \nWhen you are searching through data in a file, it is a very common pattern to read through a file, ignoring most of the lines and only processing lines which meet a particular condition. We can combine the pattern for reading a file with string methods to build simple search mechanisms.\nFor example, if we wanted to read a file and only print out lines which started with the prefix \"From:\", we could use the string method startswith to select only those lines with the desired prefix:\n\n\nWhen this program runs, we get the following output:\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\n\nFrom: louis@media.berkeley.edu\n\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\n\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\n...\n\nThe output looks great since the only lines we are seeing are those which start with \"From:\", but why are we seeing the extra blank lines? This is due to that invisible newline character. Each of the lines ends with a newline, so the print statement prints the string in the variable line which includes a newline and then print adds another newline, resulting in the double spacing effect we see.\nWe could use line slicing to print all but the last character, but a simpler approach is to use the rstrip method which strips whitespace from the right side of a string as follows:\n\n\nWhen this program runs, we get the following output:\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nFrom: louis@media.berkeley.edu\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\nFrom: cwen@iupui.edu\n...\n\nAs your file processing programs get more complicated, you may want to structure your search loops using continue. The basic idea of the search loop is that you are looking for \"interesting\" lines and effectively skipping \"uninteresting\" lines. And then when we find an interesting line, we do something with that line.\nWe can structure the loop to follow the pattern of skipping uninteresting lines as follows:\n\n\nThe output of the program is the same. In English, the uninteresting lines are those which do not start with \"From:\", which we skip using continue. For the \"interesting\" lines (i.e., those that start with \"From:\") we perform the processing on those lines.\nWe can use the find string method to simulate a text editor search that finds lines where the search string is anywhere in the line. Since find looks for an occurrence of a string within another string and either returns the position of the string or -1 if the string was not found, we can write the following loop to show lines which contain the string \"@uct.ac.za\" (i.e., they come from the University of Cape Town in South Africa):\n\n\nWhich produces the following output:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\nX-Authentication-Warning: set sender to stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za using -f\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nAuthor: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nFrom david.horwitz@uct.ac.za Fri Jan  4 07:02:32 2008\nX-Authentication-Warning: set sender to david.horwitz@uct.ac.za using -f\nFrom: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za\nAuthor: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za\n...\n\nLetting the user choose the file name \nWe really do not want to have to edit our Python code every time we want to process a different file. It would be more usable to ask the user to enter the file name string each time the program runs so they can use our program on different files without changing the Python code.\nThis is quite simple to do by reading the file name from the user using input as follows:\n\n\nWe read the file name from the user and place it in a variable named fname and open that file. Now we can run the program repeatedly on different files.\npython search6.py\nEnter the file name: mbox.txt\nThere were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt\n\npython search6.py\nEnter the file name: mbox-short.txt\nThere were 27 subject lines in mbox-short.txt\n\nBefore peeking at the next section, take a look at the above program and ask yourself, \"What could go possibly wrong here?\" or \"What might our friendly user do that would cause our nice little program to ungracefully exit with a traceback, making us look not-so-cool in the eyes of our users?\"\nUsing try, except, and open \nI told you not to peek. This is your last chance.\nWhat if our user types something that is not a file name?\npython search6.py\nEnter the file name: missing.txt\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"search6.py\", line 2, in \n    fhand = open(fname)\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'missing.txt'\n\npython search6.py\nEnter the file name: na na boo boo\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"search6.py\", line 2, in \n    fhand = open(fname)\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'na na boo boo'\n\nDo not laugh. Users will eventually do every possible thing they can do to break your programs, either on purpose or with malicious intent. As a matter of fact, an important part of any software development team is a person or group called Quality Assurance (or QA for short) whose very job it is to do the craziest things possible in an attempt to break the software that the programmer has created.\nThe QA team is responsible for finding the flaws in programs before we have delivered the program to the end users who may be purchasing the software or paying our salary to write the software. So the QA team is the programmer's best friend.\nSo now that we see the flaw in the program, we can elegantly fix it using the try/except structure. We need to assume that the open call might fail and add recovery code when the open fails as follows:\n\n\nThe exit function terminates the program. It is a function that we call that never returns. Now when our user (or QA team) types in silliness or bad file names, we \"catch\" them and recover gracefully:\npython search7.py\nEnter the file name: mbox.txt\nThere were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt\n\npython search7.py\nEnter the file name: na na boo boo\nFile cannot be opened: na na boo boo\n\nProtecting the open call is a good example of the proper use of try and except in a Python program. We use the term \"Pythonic\" when we are doing something the \"Python way\". We might say that the above example is the Pythonic way to open a file.\nOnce you become more skilled in Python, you can engage in repartee with other Python programmers to decide which of two equivalent solutions to a problem is \"more Pythonic\". The goal to be \"more Pythonic\" captures the notion that programming is part engineering and part art. We are not always interested in just making something work, we also want our solution to be elegant and to be appreciated as elegant by our peers.\nWriting files \nTo write a file, you have to open it with mode \"w\" as a second parameter:\n>>> fout = open('output.txt', 'w')\n>>> print(fout)\n\n\nIf the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, so be careful! If the file doesn't exist, a new one is created.\nThe write method of the file handle object puts data into the file, returning the number of characters written. The default write mode is text for writing (and reading) strings.\n>>> line1 = \"This here's the wattle,\\n\"\n>>> fout.write(line1)\n24\n\nAgain, the file object keeps track of where it is, so if you call write again, it adds the new data to the end.\nWe must make sure to manage the ends of lines as we write to the file by explicitly inserting the newline character when we want to end a line. The print statement automatically appends a newline, but the write method does not add the newline automatically.\n>>> line2 = 'the emblem of our land.\\n'\n>>> fout.write(line2)\n24\n\nWhen you are done writing, you have to close the file to make sure that the last bit of data is physically written to the disk so it will not be lost if the power goes off.\n>>> fout.close()\n\nWe could close the files which we open for read as well, but we can be a little sloppy if we are only opening a few files since Python makes sure that all open files are closed when the program ends. When we are writing files, we want to explicitly close the files so as to leave nothing to chance.\nDebugging \nWhen you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs, and newlines are normally invisible:\n>>> s = '1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n>>> print(s)\n1 2  3\n 4\n\nThe built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:\n>>> print(repr(s))\n'1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n\nThis can be helpful for debugging.\nOne other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented \\n. Others use a return character, represented \\r. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies might cause problems.\nFor most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can find them (and read more about this issue) at wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline. Or, of course, you could write one yourself.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the file (line by line) all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:\npython shout.py\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\nFROM STEPHEN.MARQUARD@UCT.AC.ZA SAT JAN  5 09:14:16 2008\nRETURN-PATH: \nRECEIVED: FROM MURDER (MAIL.UMICH.EDU [141.211.14.90])\n     BY FRANKENSTEIN.MAIL.UMICH.EDU (CYRUS V2.3.8) WITH LMTPA;\n     SAT, 05 JAN 2008 09:14:16 -0500\n\nYou can download the file from\nwww.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt\nExercise 2: Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file and look for lines of the form:\nX-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475\nWhen you encounter a line that starts with \"X-DSPAM-Confidence:\" pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line.

Lists","keywords":"","body":"Lists \n\nA list is a sequence\nLists are mutable\nTraversing a list\nList operations\nList slices\nList methods\nDeleting elements\nLists and functions\nLists and strings\nParsing lines\nObjects and values\nAliasing\nList arguments\nDebugging\nExercises\n\nA list is a sequence \nLike a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in list are called elements or sometimes items.\nThere are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets ([ and ]):\n[10, 20, 30, 40]\n['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']\n\nThe first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don't have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and (lo!) another list:\n['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]\n\nA list within another list is nested.\nA list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty brackets, [].\nAs you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:\nLists are mutable \nThe syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string: the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:\n>>> print(cheeses[0])\nCheddar\n\nUnlike strings, lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.\n>>> numbers = [17, 123]\n>>> numbers[1] = 5\n>>> print(numbers)\n[17, 5]\n>>>\n\nThe one-eth element of numbers, which used to be 123, is now 5.\nYou can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements. This relationship is called a mapping; each index \"maps to\" one of the elements.\nList indices work the same way as string indices:\n\nAny integer expression can be used as an index.\nIf you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError.\nIf an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.\n\nThe in operator also works on lists.\n>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']\n>>> 'Edam' in cheeses\nTrue\n>>> 'Brie' in cheeses\nFalse\n>>>\n\nTraversing a list \nThe most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:\nfor cheese in cheeses:\n    print(cheese)\n\nThis works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the functions range and len:\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\n    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n\nThis loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of elements in the list. range returns a list of indices from 0 to n − 1, where n is the length of the list. Each time through the loop, i gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.\nA for loop over an empty list never executes the body:\nfor x in empty:\n    print('This never happens.')\n\nAlthough a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is four:\n['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]\n\nList operations \nThe + operator concatenates lists:\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = [4, 5, 6]\n>>> c = a + b\n>>> print(c)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n>>>\n\nSimilarly, the operator repeats a list a given number of times:\n>>> [0] * 4\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n>>>\n\nThe first example repeats four times. The second example repeats the list three times.\nList slices \nThe slice operator also works on lists:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> t[1:3]\n['b', 'c']\n>>> t[:4]\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n>>> t[3:]\n['d', 'e', 'f']\n>>>\n\nIf you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.\n>>> t[:]\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n\nSince lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations that fold, spindle, or mutilate lists.\nA slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>>\n\nList methods \nPython provides methods that operate on lists. For example, append adds a new element to the end of a list:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.append('d')\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n\nextend takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.extend(['d', 'f'])\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f']\n\nThis example leaves t2 unmodified.\nsort arranges the elements of the list from low to high:\n>>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']\n>>> t.sort()\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n\nMost list methods are void; they modify the list and return None. If you accidentally write t = t.sort(), you will be disappointed with the result.\nDeleting elements \nThere are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element you want, you can use pop:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x = t.pop(1)\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'c']\n>>> print(x)\nb\n>>>\n\npop modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. If you don't provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.\nIf you don't need the removed value, you can use the del operator:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> del t[1]\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'c']\n>>>\n\nIf you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.remove('b')\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'c']\n>>>\n\nThe return value from remove is None.\nTo remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index:\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> del t[1:5]\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'f']\n>>>\n\nAs usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.\nLists and functions \nThere are a number of built-in functions that can be used on lists that allow you to quickly look through a list without writing your own loops:\n>>> nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]\n>>> print(len(nums))\n6\n>>> print(max(nums))\n74\n>>> print(min(nums))\n3\n>>> print(sum(nums))\n154\n>>> print(sum(nums)/len(nums))\n25.666666666666668\n\nThe sum() function only works when the list elements are numbers. The other functions (max(), len(), etc.) work with lists of strings and other types that can be comparable.\nWe could rewrite an earlier program that computed the average of a list of numbers entered by the user using a list.\nFirst, the program to compute an average without a list:\n\n\nIn this program, we have count and total variables to keep the number and running total of the user's numbers as we repeatedly prompt the user for a number.\nWe could simply remember each number as the user entered it and use built-in functions to compute the sum and count at the end.\n\n\nWe make an empty list before the loop starts, and then each time we have a number, we append it to the list. At the end of the program, we simply compute the sum of the numbers in the list and divide it by the count of the numbers in the list to come up with the average.\nLists and strings \nA string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use list:\n>>> s = 'spam'\n>>> t = list(s)\n>>> print(t)\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\n\nBecause list is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name. I also avoid the letter l because it looks too much like the number 1. So that's why I use t.\nThe list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into words, you can use the split method:\n>>> s = 'pining for the fjords'\n>>> t = s.split()\n>>> print(t)\n['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n>>> print(t[2])\nthe\n\nOnce you have used split to break the string into a list of words, you can use the index operator (square bracket) to look at a particular word in the list.\nYou can call split with an optional argument called a delimiter that specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:\n>>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'\n>>> delimiter = '-'\n>>> s.split(delimiter)\n['spam', 'spam', 'spam']\n>>>\n\njoin is the inverse of split. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. join is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:\n>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n>>> delimiter = ' '\n>>> delimiter.join(t)\n'pining for the fjords'\n\nIn this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words. To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, \"\", as a delimiter.\nParsing lines \nUsually when we are reading a file we want to do something to the lines other than just printing the whole line. Often we want to find the \"interesting lines\" and then parse the line to find some interesting part of the line. What if we wanted to print out the day of the week from those lines that start with \"From \"?\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.zaSatJan  5 09:14:16 2008\nThe split method is very effective when faced with this kind of problem. We can write a small program that looks for lines where the line starts with \"From \", split those lines, and then print out the third word in the line:\n\n\nHere we also use the contracted form of the if statement where we put the continue on the same line as the if. This contracted form of the if functions the same as if the continue were on the next line and indented.\nThe program produces the following output:\nSat\nFri\nFri\nFri\n    ...\n\nLater, we will learn increasingly sophisticated techniques for picking the lines to work on and how we pull those lines apart to find the exact bit of information we are looking for.\nObjects and values \nIf we execute these assignment statements:\na = 'banana'\nb = 'banana'\n\nwe know that a and b both refer to a string, but we don't know whether they refer to the same string. There are two possible states:\nImagen - Variables and Objects\nIn one case, a and b refer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same object.\nTo check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the is operator.\n>>> a = 'banana'\n>>> b = 'banana'\n>>> a is b\nTrue\n\nIn this example, Python only created one string object, and both a and b refer to it.\nBut when you create two lists, you get two objects:\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> a is b\nFalse\n>>>\n\nIn this case we would say that the two lists are equivalent, because they have the same elements, but not identical, because they are not the same object. If two objects are identical, they are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.\nUntil now, we have been using \"object\" and \"value\" interchangeably, but it is more precise to say that an object has a value. If you execute a = [1,2,3], a refers to a list object whose value is a particular sequence of elements. If another list has the same elements, we would say it has the same value.\nAliasing \nIf a refers to an object and you assign b = a, then both variables refer to the same object:\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = a\n>>> b\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> a[2] = 4\n>>> b\n[1, 2, 4]\n\nThe association of a variable with an object is called a reference. In this example, there are two references to the same object.\nAn object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is aliased.\nIf the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:\n>>> b[0] = 17\n>>> print(a)\n[17, 2, 3]\n\nAlthough this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.\nFor immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem. In this example:\na = 'banana'\nb = 'banana'\n\nit almost never makes a difference whether a and b refer to the same string or not.\nList arguments \nWhen you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change. For example, delete_head removes the first element from a list:\ndef delete_head(t):\n    del t[0]\n\nHere's how it is used:\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> delete_head(letters)\n>>> print(letters)\n['b', 'c']\n>>>\n\nThe parameter t and the variable letters are aliases for the same object.\nIt is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that create new lists. For example, the append method modifies a list, but the + operator creates a new list:\n>>> t1 = [1, 2]\n>>> t2 = t1.append(3)\n>>> print(t1)\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> print(t2)\nNone\n>>> t3 = t1 + [3]\n>>> print(t3)\n[1, 2, 3, 3]\n>>> t2 is t3\nFalse\n>>>\n\nThis difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function does not delete the head of a list:\ndef bad_delete_head(t):\n    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!\n\nThe slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but none of that has any effect on the list that was passed as an argument.\nAn alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail returns all but the first element of a list:\ndef tail(t):\n    return t[1:]\n\nThis function leaves the original list unmodified. Here's how it is used:\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> rest = tail(letters)\n>>> print(rest)\n['b','c']\n\nExercise 1:\nWrite a function called chop that takes a list and modifies it, removing the first and last elements, and returns None.\nThen write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the first and last elements.\nDebugging \nCareless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n\nDon't forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.\n If you are used to writing string code like this:\n word = word.strip()\n\n It is tempting to write list code like this: ~~{.python}t = t.sort() # WRONG! ~~\n Because sort returns None, the next operation you perform with t is likely to fail.\n Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like strings) are documented at https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods. The methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are documented at https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types.\n\nPick an idiom and stick with it.\n Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop, remove, del, or even a slice assignment.\n To add an element, you can use the append method or the + operator. But don't forget that these are right:\n t.append(x)\n t = t + [x]\n\n And these are wrong:\n t.append([x])          # WRONG!\n t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!\n t + [x]                # WRONG!\n t = t + x              # WRONG!\n\n\n\nTry out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.\n\nMake copies to avoid aliasing.\n If you want to use a method like sort that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\n orig = t[:]\n t.sort()\n\n In this example you could also use the built-in function sorted, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone. But in that case you should avoid using sorted as a variable name!\n\nLists, split, and files\n When we read and parse files, there are many opportunities to encounter input that can crash our program so it is a good idea to revisit the guardian pattern when it comes writing programs that read through a file and look for a \"needle in the haystack\".\n Let's revisit our program that is looking for the day of the week on the from lines of our file:\n From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.zaSatJan  5 09:14:16 2008\n Since we are breaking this line into words, we could dispense with the use of startswith and simply look at the first word of the line to determine if we are interested in the line at all. We can use continue to skip lines that don't have \"From\" as the first word as follows:\n fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\n for line in fhand:\n     words = line.split()\n     if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n     print(words[2])\n\n This looks much simpler and we don't even need to do the rstrip to remove the newline at the end of the file. But is it better?\n python search8.py\n Sat\n Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \"search8.py\", line 5, in \n     if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n IndexError: list index out of range\n\n It kind of works and we see the day from the first line (Sat), but then the program fails with a traceback error. What went wrong? What messed-up data caused our elegant, clever, and very Pythonic program to fail?\n You could stare at it for a long time and puzzle through it or ask someone for help, but the quicker and smarter approach is to add a print statement. The best place to add the print statement is right before the line where the program failed and print out the data that seems to be causing the failure.\n Now this approach may generate a lot of lines of output, but at least you will immediately have some clue as to the problem at hand. So we add a print of the variable words right before line five. We even add a prefix \"Debug:\" to the line so we can keep our regular output separate from our debug output.\n for line in fhand:\n     words = line.split()\n     print('Debug:', words)\n     if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n     print(words[2])\n\n When we run the program, a lot of output scrolls off the screen but at the end, we see our debug output and the traceback so we know what happened just before the traceback.\n Debug: ['X-DSPAM-Confidence:', '0.8475']\n Debug: ['X-DSPAM-Probability:', '0.0000']\n Debug: []\n Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \"search9.py\", line 6, in \n     if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n IndexError: list index out of range\n\n Each debug line is printing the list of words which we get when we split the line into words. When the program fails, the list of words is empty []. If we open the file in a text editor and look at the file, at that point it looks as follows:\n X-DSPAM-Result: Innocent\n X-DSPAM-Processed: Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475\n X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000\n\n Details: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/?view=rev&rev=39772\n\n The error occurs when our program encounters a blank line! Of course there are \"zero words\" on a blank line. Why didn't we think of that when we were writing the code? When the code looks for the first word (word[0]) to check to see if it matches \"From\", we get an \"index out of range\" error.\n This of course is the perfect place to add some guardian code to avoid checking the first word if the first word is not there. There are many ways to protect this code; we will choose to check the number of words we have before we look at the first word:\n fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\n count = 0\n for line in fhand:\n     words = line.split()\n     # print 'Debug:', words\n     if len(words) == 0 : continue\n     if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n     print(words[2])\n\n First we commented out the debug print statement instead of removing it, in case our modification fails and we need to debug again. Then we added a guardian statement that checks to see if we have zero words, and if so, we use continue to skip to the next line in the file.\n We can think of the two continue statements as helping us refine the set of lines which are \"interesting\" to us and which we want to process some more. A line which has no words is \"uninteresting\" to us so we skip to the next line. A line which does not have \"From\" as its first word is uninteresting to us so we skip it.\n The program as modified runs successfully, so perhaps it is correct. Our guardian statement does make sure that the words[0] will never fail, but perhaps it is not enough. When we are programming, we must always be thinking, \"What might go wrong?\n\n\nExercise 2: Figure out which line of the above program is still not properly guarded. See if you can construct a text file which causes the program to fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and test it to make sure it handles your new text file.\nExercise 3: Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without two if statements. Instead, use a compound logical expression using the and logical operator with a single if statement.\nExercises \nExercise 4: Download a copy of the file from www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt\nWrite a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split function.\nFor each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the list, add it to the list.\nWhen the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.\nEnter file: romeo.txt\n['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already',\n'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief',\n'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft',\n'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window',\n'with', 'yonder']\n\nExercise 5: Write a program to read through the mail box data and when you find line that starts with \"From\", you will split the line into words using the split function. We are interested in who sent the message, which is the second word on the From line.\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\nYou will parse the From line and print out the second word for each From line, then you will also count the number of From (not From:) lines and print out a count at the end.\nThis is a good sample output with a few lines removed:\npython fromcount.py\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\nstephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nlouis@media.berkeley.edu\nzqian@umich.edu\n\n[...some output removed...]\n\nray@media.berkeley.edu\ncwen@iupui.edu\ncwen@iupui.edu\ncwen@iupui.edu\nThere were 27 lines in the file with From as the first word\n\nExercise 6: Rewrite the program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum of the numbers at the end when the user enters \"done\". Write the program to store the numbers the user enters in a list and use the max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum numbers after the loop completes.\nEnter a number: 6\nEnter a number: 2\nEnter a number: 9\nEnter a number: 3\nEnter a number: 5\nEnter a number: done\nMaximum: 9.0\nMinimum: 2.0\n\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

In a list, the index positions have to be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.\nYou can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.\nAs an example, we'll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\nThe function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\nnamed_variable = dict()\n# you also can create one as follows\nnamed_variable_2 = {}\n\nThe curly brackets, {}, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:\n>>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n\nThis line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value \"uno\". If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\n>>> print(eng2sp)\n{'one': 'uno'}\n\nThis output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items. But if you print eng2sp, you might be surprised:\n>>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}\n>>> print(eng2sp)\n{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}\n\nThe order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.\nBut that's not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:\n>>> print(eng2sp['two'])\n'dos'\n\nThe key 'two' always maps to the value \"dos\" so the order of the items doesn't matter.\nIf the key isn't in the dictionary, you get an exception:\n>>> print(eng2sp['four'])\nKeyError: 'four'\n\nThe len function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:\n>>> len(eng2sp)\n3\n\nThe in operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).\n>>> 'one' in eng2sp\nTrue\n>>> 'uno' in eng2sp\nFalse\n\nTo see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method values, which returns the values as a list, and then use the in operator:\n>>> 'uno' in eng2sp.values()\nTrue\n\nThe in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a hash table that has a remarkable property: the in operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary. I won't explain why hash functions are so magical, but you can read more about it at wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table.\nExercise 1: [wordlist2]\nWrite a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn't matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.\nDictionary as a set of counters \nSuppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:\n\nYou could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.\nYou could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.\nYou could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.\n\nEach of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.\nAn implementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don't have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\nHere is what the code might look like:\nword = 'brontosaurus'\nd = {}\nfor c in word:\n  if c not in d:\n    d[c] = 1\n  else:\n    d[c] = d[c] + 1\nprint(d)\n\nWe are effectively computing a histogram, which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or frequencies).\nThe for loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character c is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key c and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If c is already in the dictionary we increment d[c].\nHere's the output of the program:\n{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}\n\nThe histogram indicates that the letters 'a' and \"b\" appear once; \"o\" appears twice, and so on.\nDictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:\n>>> counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}\n>>> print(counts.get('jan', 0))\n100\n>>> print(counts.get('tim', 0))\n0\n\nWe can use get to write our histogram loop more concisely. Because the get method automatically handles the case where a key is not in a dictionary, we can reduce four lines down to one and eliminate the if statement.\nword = 'brontosaurus'\nd = dict()\nfor c in word:\n    d[c] = d.get(c,0) + 1\nprint(d)\n\nThe use of the get method to simplify this counting loop ends up being a very commonly used \"idiom\" in Python and we will use it many times in the rest of the book. So you should take a moment and compare the loop using the if statement and in operator with the loop using the get method. They do exactly the same thing, but one is more succinct.\nDictionaries and files \nOne of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a file with some written text. Let's start with a very simple file of words taken from the text of Romeo and Juliet.\nFor the first set of examples, we will use a shortened and simplified version of the text with no punctuation. Later we will work with the text of the scene with punctuation included.\nBut soft what light through yonder window breaks\nIt is the east and Juliet is the sun\nArise fair sun and kill the envious moon\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\n\nWe will write a Python program to read through the lines of the file, break each line into a list of words, and then loop through each of the words in the line and count each word using a dictionary.\nYou will see that we have two for loops. The outer loop is reading the lines of the file and the inner loop is iterating through each of the words on that particular line. This is an example of a pattern called nested loops because one of the loops is the outer loop and the other loop is the inner loop.\nBecause the inner loop executes all of its iterations each time the outer loop makes a single iteration, we think of the inner loop as iterating \"more quickly\" and the outer loop as iterating more slowly.\nThe combination of the two nested loops ensures that we will count every word on every line of the input file.\n\n\nWhen we run the program, we see a raw dump of all of the counts in unsorted hash order. (the romeo.txt file is available at www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt)\npython count1.py\nEnter the file name: romeo.txt\n{'and': 3, 'envious': 1, 'already': 1, 'fair': 1,\n'is': 3, 'through': 1, 'pale': 1, 'yonder': 1,\n'what': 1, 'sun': 2, 'Who': 1, 'But': 1, 'moon': 1,\n'window': 1, 'sick': 1, 'east': 1, 'breaks': 1,\n'grief': 1, 'with': 1, 'light': 1, 'It': 1, 'Arise': 1,\n'kill': 1, 'the': 3, 'soft': 1, 'Juliet': 1}\n\nIt is a bit inconvenient to look through the dictionary to find the most common words and their counts, so we need to add some more Python code to get us the output that will be more helpful.\nLooping and dictionaries \nIf you use a dictionary as the sequence in a for statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. This loop prints each key and the corresponding value:\ncounts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}\nfor key in counts:\n    print(key, counts[key])\n\nHere's what the output looks like:\njan 100\nchuck 1\nannie 42\n\nAgain, the keys are in no particular order.\nWe can use this pattern to implement the various loop idioms that we have described earlier. For example if we wanted to find all the entries in a dictionary with a value above ten, we could write the following code:\ncounts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}\nfor key in counts:\n    if counts[key] > 10 :\n        print(key, counts[key])\n\nThe for loop iterates through the keys of the dictionary, so we must use the index operator to retrieve the corresponding value for each key. Here's what the output looks like:\njan 100\nannie 42\n\nWe see only the entries with a value above 10.\nIf you want to print the keys in alphabetical order, you first make a list of the keys in the dictionary using the keys method available in dictionary objects, and then sort that list and loop through the sorted list, looking up each key and printing out key-value pairs in sorted order as follows:\ncounts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}\nlst = list(counts.keys())\nprint(lst)\nlst.sort()\nfor key in lst:\n    print(key, counts[key])\n\nHere's what the output looks like:\n['jan', 'chuck', 'annie']\nannie 42\nchuck 1\njan 100\n\nFirst you see the list of keys in unsorted order that we get from the keys method. Then we see the key-value pairs in order from the for loop.\nAdvanced text parsing \nIn the above example using the file romeo.txt, we made the file as simple as possible by removing all punctuation by hand. The actual text has lots of punctuation, as shown below.\nBut, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief,\n\nSince the Python split function looks for spaces and treats words as tokens separated by spaces, we would treat the words \"soft!\" and \"soft\" as different words and create a separate dictionary entry for each word.\nAlso since the file has capitalization, we would treat \"who\" and \"Who\" as different words with different counts.\nWe can solve both these problems by using the string methods lower, punctuation, and translate. The translate is the most subtle of the methods. Here is the documentation for translate:\nline.translate(str.maketrans(fromstr, tostr, deletestr))\nReplace the characters in fromstr with the character in the same position in tostr and delete all characters that are in deletestr. The fromstr and tostr can be empty strings and the deletestr parameter can be omitted.\nWe will not specify the table but we will use the deletechars parameter to delete all of the punctuation. We will even let Python tell us the list of characters that it considers \"punctuation\":\n>>> import string\n>>> string.punctuation\n'!\"#$%&amp;\\'()*+,-./:;?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'\n\nThe parameters used by translate were different in Python 2.0.\nWe make the following modifications to our program:\n\n\nPart of learning the \"Art of Python\" or \"Thinking Pythonically\" is realizing that Python often has built-in capabilities for many common data analysis problems. Over time, you will see enough example code and read enough of the documentation to know where to look to see if someone has already written something that makes your job much easier.\nThe following is an abbreviated version of the output:\nEnter the file name: romeo-full.txt\n{'swearst': 1, 'all': 6, 'afeard': 1, 'leave': 2, 'these': 2,\n'kinsmen': 2, 'what': 11, 'thinkst': 1, 'love': 24, 'cloak': 1,\na': 24, 'orchard': 2, 'light': 5, 'lovers': 2, 'romeo': 40,\n'maiden': 1, 'whiteupturned': 1, 'juliet': 32, 'gentleman': 1,\n'it': 22, 'leans': 1, 'canst': 1, 'having': 1, ...}\n\nLooking through this output is still unwieldy and we can use Python to give us exactly what we are looking for, but to do so, we need to learn about Python tuples. We will pick up this example once we learn about tuples.\nDebugging \nAs you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking data by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\nScale down the input\nIf possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first n lines.\nIf there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.\nCheck summaries and types\nInstead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.\nA common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\nAnother kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a \"consistency check\".\nPretty print the output\nFormatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error.\nAgain, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging. \nExercises \nExercise 2: Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done. To do this look for lines that start with \"From\", then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the week. At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order does not matter).\nSample Line:\n    From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n\nSample Execution:\npython dow.py\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\n{'Fri': 20, 'Thu': 6, 'Sat': 1}\n\nExercise 3: Write a program to read through a mail log, build a histogram using a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address, and print the dictionary.\nEnter file name: mbox-short.txt\n{'gopal.ramasammycook@gmail.com': 1, 'louis@media.berkeley.edu': 3,\n'cwen@iupui.edu': 5, 'antranig@caret.cam.ac.uk': 1,\n'rjlowe@iupui.edu': 2, 'gsilver@umich.edu': 3,\n'david.horwitz@uct.ac.za': 4, 'wagnermr@iupui.edu': 1,\n'zqian@umich.edu': 4, 'stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za': 2,\n'ray@media.berkeley.edu': 1}\n\nExercise 4: Add code to the above program to figure out who has the most messages in the file.\nAfter all the data has been read and the dictionary has been created, look through the dictionary using a maximum loop (see Section [maximumloop]) to find who has the most messages and print how many messages the person has.\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\ncwen@iupui.edu 5\n\nEnter a file name: mbox.txt\nzqian@umich.edu 195\n\nExercise 5: This program records the domain name (instead of the address) where the message was sent from instead of who the mail came from (i.e., the whole email address). At the end of the program, print out the contents of your dictionary.\npython schoolcount.py\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\n{'media.berkeley.edu': 4, 'uct.ac.za': 6, 'umich.edu': 7,\n'gmail.com': 1, 'caret.cam.ac.uk': 1, 'iupui.edu': 8}\n\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

Tuples","keywords":"","body":"Tuples \nTuples are immutable \nA tuple1 is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples are also comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.\nSyntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:\n>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'\n\nAlthough it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses to help us quickly identify tuples when we look at Python code:\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n\nTo create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:\n>>> var_tupla = 'a',\n>>> type(var_tupla)\n\n\nWithout the comma Python treats ('a') as an expression with a string in parentheses that evaluates to a string:\n>>> t2 = ('a')\n>>> type(t2)\n\n\nAnother way to construct a tuple is the built-in function tuple. With no argument, it creates an empty ; or with ():\n>>> t2 = ()\n>>> type(t2)\n\n\nIf the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of the call to tuple is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:\n>>> t = tuple('lupins')\n>>> print(t)\n('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')\n\nBecause tuple is the name of a constructor, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\nMost list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element:\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n>>> print(t[0])\na\n\nAnd the slice operator selects a range of elements.\n>>> print(t[1:3])\n('b', 'c')\n\nBut if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:\n>>> t[0] = 'A'\nTypeError: object doesn't support item assignment\n\nYou can't modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n>>> t = ('A',) + t\n>>> t\n('A', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n\nComparing tuples \nThe comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big).\nThe sort function works the same way. It sorts primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts by second element, and so on.\nThis feature lends itself to a pattern called DSU for\nDecorate\na sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,\nSort\nthe list of tuples using the Python built-in sort, and\nUndecorate\nby extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.\n[DSU]\nFor example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to sort them from longest to shortest:\n\n\nThe first loop builds a list of tuples, where each tuple is a word preceded by its length.\nsort compares the first element, length, first, and only considers the second element to break ties. The keyword argument reverse=True tells sort to go in decreasing order.\nThe second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of words in descending order of length. The four-character words are sorted in reverse alphabetical order, so \"what\" appears before \"soft\" in the following list.\nThe output of the program is as follows:\n['yonder', 'window', 'breaks', 'light', 'what',\n'soft', 'but', 'in']\n\nOf course the line loses much of its poetic impact when turned into a Python list and sorted in descending word length order.\nTuple assignment \nOne of the unique syntactic features of the Python language is the ability to have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement. This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.\nIn this example we have a two-element list (which is a sequence) and assign the first and second elements of the sequence to the variables x and y in a single statement.\n>>> m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]\n>>> x, y = m\n>>> x\n'have'\n>>> y\n'fun'\n\nIt is not magic, Python roughly translates the tuple assignment syntax to be the following:2\n>>> m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]\n>>> x = m[0]\n>>> y = m[1]\n>>> x\n'have'\n>>> y\n'fun'\n\nStylistically when we use a tuple on the left side of the assignment statement, we omit the parentheses, but the following is an equally valid syntax:\n>>> m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]\n>>> (x, y) = m\n>>> x\n'have'\n>>> y\n'fun'\n>>>\n\nA particularly clever application of tuple assignment allows us to swap the values of two variables in a single statement:\n>>> a, b = b, a\n\nBoth sides of this statement are tuples, but the left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value on the right side is assigned to its respective variable on the left side. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.\nThe number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right must be the same:\n>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3\nValueError: too many values to unpack\n\nMore generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list, or tuple). For example, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:\n>>> addr = 'monty@python.org'\n>>> uname, domain = addr.split('@')\n\nThe return value from split is a list with two elements; the first element is assigned to uname, the second to domain.\n>>> print(uname)\nmonty\n>>> print(domain)\npython.org\n\nDictionaries and tuples \nDictionaries have a method called items that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:\n>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}\n>>> t = list(d.items())\n>>> print(t)\n[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]\n\nAs you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order.\nHowever, since the list of tuples is a list, and tuples are comparable, we can now sort the list of tuples. Converting a dictionary to a list of tuples is a way for us to output the contents of a dictionary sorted by key:\n>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}\n>>> t = list(d.items())\n>>> t\n[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]\n>>> t.sort()\n>>> t\n[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]\n\nThe new list is sorted in ascending alphabetical order by the key value.\nMultiple assignment with dictionaries \nCombining items, tuple assignment, and for, you can see a nice code pattern for traversing the keys and values of a dictionary in a single loop:\nfor key, val in list(d.items()):\n    print(val, key)\n\nThis loop has two iteration variables because items returns a list of tuples and key, val is a tuple assignment that successively iterates through each of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.\nFor each iteration through the loop, both key and value are advanced to the next key-value pair in the dictionary (still in hash order).\nThe output of this loop is:\n10 a\n22 c\n1 b\n\nAgain, it is in hash key order (i.e., no particular order).\nIf we combine these two techniques, we can print out the contents of a dictionary sorted by the value stored in each key-value pair.\nTo do this, we first make a list of tuples where each tuple is (value, key). The items method would give us a list of (key, value) tuples, but this time we want to sort by value, not key. Once we have constructed the list with the value-key tuples, it is a simple matter to sort the list in reverse order and print out the new, sorted list.\n>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}\n>>> l = list()\n>>> for key, val in d.items() :\n...     l.append( (val, key) )\n...\n>>> l\n[(10, 'a'), (22, 'c'), (1, 'b')]\n>>> l.sort(reverse=True)\n>>> l\n[(22, 'c'), (10, 'a'), (1, 'b')]\n>>>\n\nBy carefully constructing the list of tuples to have the value as the first element of each tuple, we can sort the list of tuples and get our dictionary contents sorted by value.\nThe most common words \nComing back to our running example of the text from Romeo and Juliet Act 2, Scene 2, we can augment our program to use this technique to print the ten most common words in the text as follows:\n\n\nThe first part of the program which reads the file and computes the dictionary that maps each word to the count of words in the document is unchanged. But instead of simply printing out counts and ending the program, we construct a list of (val, key) tuples and then sort the list in reverse order.\nSince the value is first, it will be used for the comparisons. If there is more than one tuple with the same value, it will look at the second element (the key), so tuples where the value is the same will be further sorted by the alphabetical order of the key.\nAt the end we write a nice for loop which does a multiple assignment iteration and prints out the ten most common words by iterating through a slice of the list (lst[:10]).\nSo now the output finally looks like what we want for our word frequency analysis.\n61 i\n42 and\n40 romeo\n34 to\n34 the\n32 thou\n32 juliet\n30 that\n29 my\n24 thee\n\nThe fact that this complex data parsing and analysis can be done with an easy-to-understand 19-line Python program is one reason why Python is a good choice as a language for exploring information.\nUsing tuples as keys in dictionaries \nBecause tuples are hashable and lists are not, if we want to create a composite key to use in a dictionary we must use a tuple as the key.\nWe would encounter a composite key if we wanted to create a telephone directory that maps from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers. Assuming that we have defined the variables last, first, and number, we could write a dictionary assignment statement as follows:\ndirectory[last,first] = number\n\nThe expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment in a for loop to traverse this dictionary.\nfor last, first in directory:\n    print(first, last, directory[last,first])\n\nThis loop traverses the keys in directory, which are tuples. It assigns the elements of each tuple to last and first, then prints the name and corresponding telephone number.\nSequences: strings, lists, and tuples - Oh My! \nI have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.\nIn many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists, and tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one over the others?\nTo start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the elements have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters instead.\nLists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:\n\nIn some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.\nIf you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.\nIf you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.\n\nBecause tuples are immutable, they don't provide methods like sort and reverse, which modify existing lists. However Python provides the built-in functions sorted and reversed, which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new sequence with the same elements in a different order.\nDebugging \nLists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as data structures; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that contain tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call shape errors; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or composition, or perhaps you write some code and forget the shape of your data and introduce an error.\nFor example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won't work.\nWhen you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are four things to try:\nreading\nExamine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you meant to say.\nrunning\nExperiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to spend some time to build scaffolding.\nruminating\nTake some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem you're seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?\nAt some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start rebuilding.\nBeginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode. \nFor example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don't understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head.\nRunning experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call \"random walk programming\", which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.\nYou have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\nTaking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem to someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question.\nBut even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.\nBeginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can't stand to delete a line of code (even if it's wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces back in a little bit at a time.\nFinding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the \"From\" lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages from each person using a dictionary.\nAfter all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most commits.\nSample Line:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\ncwen@iupui.edu 5\n\nEnter a file name: mbox.txt\nzqian@umich.edu 195\n\nExercise 2: This program counts the distribution of the hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour from the \"From\" line by finding the time string and then splitting that string into parts using the colon character. Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, one per line, sorted by hour as shown below.\nSample Execution:\npython timeofday.py\nEnter a file name: mbox-short.txt\n04 3\n06 1\n07 1\n09 2\n10 3\n11 6\n14 1\n15 2\n16 4\n17 2\n18 1\n19 1\n\nExercise 3: Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters in decreasing order of frequency. Your program should convert all the input to lower case and only count the letters a-z. Your program should not count spaces, digits, punctuation, or anything other than the letters a-z. Find text samples from several different languages and see how letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with the tables at wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies.\n\n\n1.

We have been\nusing string methods like split and find and using lists and string slicing to extract portions of the lines.\nThis task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a very powerful library called regular expressions that handles many of these tasks quite elegantly. The reason we have not introduced regular expressions earlier in the book is because while they are very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes some getting used to.\nRegular expressions are almost their own little programming language for searching and parsing strings. As a matter of fact, entire books have been written on the topic of regular expressions. In this chapter, we will only cover the basics of regular expressions. For more detail on regular expressions, see:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html\nThe regular expression library re must be imported into your program before you can use it. The simplest use of the regular expression library is the search() function. The following program demonstrates a trivial use of the search function.\n# Search for lines that contain 'From'\nimport re\nhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\nfor line in hand:\n    line = line.rstrip()\n    if re.search('From:', line):\n        print(line)\n\n# Code: http://www.py4e.com/code3/re01.py\n\nWe open the file, loop through each line, and use the regular expression search() to only print out lines that contain the string \"From:\". This program does not use the real power of regular expressions, since we could have just as easily used line.find() to accomplish the same result.\nThe power of the regular expressions comes when we add special characters to the search string that allow us to more precisely control which lines match the string. Adding these special characters to our regular expression allow us to do sophisticated matching and extraction while writing very little code.\nFor example, the caret character is used in regular expressions to match \"the beginning\" of a line. We could change our program to only match lines where \"From:\" was at the beginning of the line as follows:\n\n\nNow we will only match lines that start with the string \"From:\". This is still a very simple example that we could have done equivalently with the startswith() method from the string library. But it serves to introduce the notion that regular expressions contain special action characters that give us more control as to what will match the regular expression.\nCharacter matching in regular expressions \nThere are a number of other special characters that let us build even more powerful regular expressions. The most commonly used special character is the period or full stop, which matches any character.\nIn the following example, the regular expression \"F..m:\" would match any of the strings \"From:\", \"Fxxm:\", \"F12m:\", or \"F!@m:\" since the period characters in the regular expression match any character.\n\n\nThis is particularly powerful when combined with the ability to indicate that a character can be repeated any number of times using the \"*\" or \"+\" characters in your regular expression. These special characters mean that instead of matching a single character in the search string, they match zero-or-more characters (in the case of the asterisk) or one-or-more of the characters (in the case of the plus sign).\nWe can further narrow down the lines that we match using a repeated wild card character in the following example:\n\n\nThe search string \"^From:.+@\" will successfully match lines that start with \"From:\", followed by one or more characters (\".+\"), followed by an at-sign. So this will match the following line:\nFrom: uct.ac.za\nYou can think of the \".+\" wildcard as expanding to match all the characters between the colon character and the at-sign.\nFrom:\nIt is good to think of the plus and asterisk characters as \"pushy\". For example, the following string would match the last at-sign in the string as the \".+\" pushes outwards, as shown below:\nFrom:iupui.edu\nIt is possible to tell an asterisk or plus sign not to be so \"greedy\" by adding another character. See the detailed documentation for information on turning off the greedy behavior.\nExtracting data using regular expressions \nIf we want to extract data from a string in Python we can use the findall() method to extract all of the substrings which match a regular expression. Let's use the example of wanting to extract anything that looks like an email address from any line regardless of format. For example, we want to pull the email addresses from each of the following lines:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\nReturn-Path: \n          for ;\nReceived: (from apache@localhost)\nAuthor: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\n\nWe don't want to write code for each of the types of lines, splitting and slicing differently for each line. This following program uses findall() to find the lines with email addresses in them and extract one or more addresses from each of those lines.\n\n\nThe findall() method searches the string in the second argument and returns a list of all of the strings that look like email addresses. We are using a two-character sequence that matches a non-whitespace character (\\S).\nThe output of the program would be:\n['csev@umich.edu', 'cwen@iupui.edu']\n\nTranslating the regular expression, we are looking for substrings that have at least one non-whitespace character, followed by an at-sign, followed by at least one more non-whitespace character. The \"\\S+\" matches as many non-whitespace characters as possible.\nThe regular expression would match twice (csev@umich.edu and cwen@iupui.edu), but it would not match the string \"@2PM\" because there are no non-blank characters before the at-sign. We can use this regular expression in a program to read all the lines in a file and print out anything that looks like an email address as follows:\n\n\nWe read each line and then extract all the substrings that match our regular expression. Since findall() returns a list, we simply check if the number of elements in our returned list is more than zero to print only lines where we found at least one substring that looks like an email address.\nIf we run the program on mbox.txt we get the following output:\n['wagnermr@iupui.edu']\n['cwen@iupui.edu']\n['']\n['']\n[';']\n[';']\n[';']\n['apache@localhost)']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org;']\n\nSome of our email addresses have incorrect characters like \"\" or \";\" at the beginning or end. Let's declare that we are only interested in the portion of the string that starts and ends with a letter or a number.\nTo do this, we use another feature of regular expressions. Square brackets are used to indicate a set of multiple acceptable characters we are willing to consider matching. In a sense, the \"\\S\" is asking to match the set of \"non-whitespace characters\". Now we will be a little more explicit in terms of the characters we will match.\nHere is our new regular expression:\n[a-zA-Z0-9]\\S*@\\S*[a-zA-Z]\n\nThis is getting a little complicated and you can begin to see why regular expressions are their own little language unto themselves. Translating this regular expression, we are looking for substrings that start with a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or number \"[a-zA-Z0-9]\", followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\"\\S\"), followed by an at-sign, followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\"\\S\"), followed by an uppercase or lowercase letter. Note that we switched from \"+\" to \"\" to indicate zero or more non-blank characters since \"[a-zA-Z0-9]\" is already one non-blank character. Remember that the \"\" or \"+\" applies to the single character immediately to the left of the plus or asterisk.\nIf we use this expression in our program, our data is much cleaner:\n\n\n...\n['wagnermr@iupui.edu']\n['cwen@iupui.edu']\n['postmaster@collab.sakaiproject.org']\n['200801032122.m03LMFo4005148@nakamura.uits.iupui.edu']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org']\n['apache@localhost']\n\nNotice that on the \"source@collab.sakaiproject.org\" lines, our regular expression eliminated two letters at the end of the string (\">;\"). This is because when we append \"[a-zA-Z]\" to the end of our regular expression, we are demanding that whatever string the regular expression parser finds must end with a letter. So when it sees the \">\" after \"sakaiproject.org>;\" it simply stops at the last \"matching\" letter it found (i.e., the \"g\" was the last good match).\nAlso note that the output of the program is a Python list that has a string as the single element in the list.\nCombining searching and extracting \nIf we want to find numbers on lines that start with the string \"X-\" such as:\nX-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475\nX-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000\n\nwe don't just want any floating-point numbers from any lines. We only want to extract numbers from lines that have the above syntax.\nWe can construct the following regular expression to select the lines:\n^X-.*: [0-9.]+\n\nTranslating this, we are saying, we want lines that start with \"X-\", followed by zero or more characters (\".*\"), followed by a colon (\":\") and then a space. After the space we are looking for one or more characters that are either a digit (0-9) or a period \"[0-9.]+\". Note that inside the square brackets, the period matches an actual period (i.e., it is not a wildcard between the square brackets).\nThis is a very tight expression that will pretty much match only the lines we are interested in as follows:\n\n\nWhen we run the program, we see the data nicely filtered to show only the lines we are looking for.\nX-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475\nX-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000\nX-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.6178\nX-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000\n\nBut now we have to solve the problem of extracting the numbers. While it would be simple enough to use split, we can use another feature of regular expressions to both search and parse the line at the same time.\nParentheses are another special character in regular expressions. When you add parentheses to a regular expression, they are ignored when matching the string. But when you are using findall(), parentheses indicate that while you want the whole expression to match, you only are interested in extracting a portion of the substring that matches the regular expression.\nSo we make the following change to our program:\n\n\nInstead of calling search(), we add parentheses around the part of the regular expression that represents the floating-point number to indicate we only want findall() to give us back the floating-point number portion of the matching string.\nThe output from this program is as follows:\n['0.8475']\n['0.0000']\n['0.6178']\n['0.0000']\n['0.6961']\n['0.0000']\n..\n\nThe numbers are still in a list and need to be converted from strings to floating point, but we have used the power of regular expressions to both search and extract the information we found interesting.\nAs another example of this technique, if you look at the file there are a number of lines of the form:\nDetails: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/?view=rev&amp;rev=39772\n\nIf we wanted to extract all of the revision numbers (the integer number at the end of these lines) using the same technique as above, we could write the following program:\n\n\nTranslating our regular expression, we are looking for lines that start with \"Details:\", followed by any number of characters (\".*\"), followed by \"rev=\", and then by one or more digits. We want to find lines that match the entire expression but we only want to extract the integer number at the end of the line, so we surround \"[0-9]+\" with parentheses.\nWhen we run the program, we get the following output:\n['39772']\n['39771']\n['39770']\n['39769']\n...\n\nRemember that the \"[0-9]+\" is \"greedy\" and it tries to make as large a string of digits as possible before extracting those digits. This \"greedy\" behavior is why we get all five digits for each number. The regular expression library expands in both directions until it encounters a non-digit, or the beginning or the end of a line.\nNow we can use regular expressions to redo an exercise from earlier in the book where we were interested in the time of day of each mail message. We looked for lines of the form:\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n\nand wanted to extract the hour of the day for each line. Previously we did this with two calls to split. First the line was split into words and then we pulled out the fifth word and split it again on the colon character to pull out the two characters we were interested in.\nWhile this worked, it actually results in pretty brittle code that is assuming the lines are nicely formatted. If you were to add enough error checking (or a big try/except block) to insure that your program never failed when presented with incorrectly formatted lines, the code would balloon to 10-15 lines of code that was pretty hard to read.\nWe can do this in a far simpler way with the following regular expression:\n^From .* [0-9][0-9]:\n\nThe translation of this regular expression is that we are looking for lines that start with \"From \" (note the space), followed by any number of characters (\".*\"), followed by a space, followed by two digits \"[0-9][0-9]\", followed by a colon character. This is the definition of the kinds of lines we are looking for.\nIn order to pull out only the hour using findall(), we add parentheses around the two digits as follows:\n^From .* ([0-9][0-9]):\n\nThis results in the following program:\n\n\nWhen the program runs, it produces the following output:\n['09']\n['18']\n['16']\n['15']\n...\n\nEscape character \nSince we use special characters in regular expressions to match the beginning or end of a line or specify wild cards, we need a way to indicate that these characters are \"normal\" and we want to match the actual character such as a dollar sign or caret.\nWe can indicate that we want to simply match a character by prefixing that character with a backslash. For example, we can find money amounts with the following regular expression.\nimport re\nx = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'\ny = re.findall('\\$[0-9.]+',x)\n\nSince we prefix the dollar sign with a backslash, it actually matches the dollar sign in the input string instead of matching the \"end of line\", and the rest of the regular expression matches one or more digits or the period character. Note: Inside square brackets, characters are not \"special\". So when we say \"[0-9.]\", it really means digits or a period. Outside of square brackets, a period is the \"wild-card\" character and matches any character. Inside square brackets, the period is a period.\nSummary \nWhile this only scratched the surface of regular expressions, we have learned a bit about the language of regular expressions. They are search strings with special characters in them that communicate your wishes to the regular expression system as to what defines \"matching\" and what is extracted from the matched strings. Here are some of those special characters and character sequences:\n^ Matches the beginning of the line.\n$ Matches the end of the line.\n. Matches any character (a wildcard).\n\\s Matches a whitespace character.\n\\S Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \\s).\n* Applies to the immediately preceding character and indicates to match zero or more of the preceding character(s).\n*? Applies to the immediately preceding character and indicates to match zero or more of the preceding character(s) in \"non-greedy mode\".\n+ Applies to the immediately preceding character and indicates to match one or more of the preceding character(s).\n+? Applies to the immediately preceding character and indicates to match one or more of the preceding character(s) in \"non-greedy mode\".\n[aeiou] Matches a single character as long as that character is in the specified set. In this example, it would match \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\", but no other characters.\n[a-z0-9] You can specify ranges of characters using the minus sign. This example is a single character that must be a lowercase letter or a digit.\n[^A-Za-z] When the first character in the set notation is a caret, it inverts the logic. This example matches a single character that is anything other than an uppercase or lowercase letter.\n( ) When parentheses are added to a regular expression, they are ignored for the purpose of matching, but allow you to extract a particular subset of the matched string rather than the whole string when using findall().\n\\b Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.\n\\B Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.\n\\d Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].\n\\D Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to the set [^0-9].\nBonus section for Unix / Linux users \nSupport for searching files using regular expressions was built into the Unix operating system since the 1960s and it is available in nearly all programming languages in one form or another.\nAs a matter of fact, there is a command-line program built into Unix called grep (Generalized Regular Expression Parser) that does pretty much the same as the search() examples in this chapter. So if you have a Macintosh or Linux system, you can try the following commands in your command-line window.\n$ grep '^From:' mbox-short.txt\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\nFrom: louis@media.berkeley.edu\nFrom: zqian@umich.edu\nFrom: rjlowe@iupui.edu\n\nThis tells grep to show you lines that start with the string \"From:\" in the file mbox-short.txt. If you experiment with the grep command a bit and read the documentation for grep, you will find some subtle differences between the regular expression support in Python and the regular expression support in grep. As an example, grep does not support the non-blank character \"\\S\" so you will need to use the slightly more complex set notation \"[^ ]\", which simply means match a character that is anything other than a space.\nDebugging \nPython has some simple and rudimentary built-in documentation that can be quite helpful if you need a quick refresher to trigger your memory about the exact name of a particular method. This documentation can be viewed in the Python interpreter in interactive mode.\nYou can bring up an interactive help system using help().\n>>> help()\nhelp> modules\n\nIf you know what module you want to use, you can use the dir() command to find the methods in the module as follows:\n>>> import re\n>>> dir(re)\n['A', 'ASCII', 'DEBUG', 'DOTALL', 'I', 'IGNORECASE', 'L', 'LOCALE', 'M', 'MULTILINE', 'RegexFlag', 'S', 'Scanner', 'T', 'TEMPLATE', 'U', 'UNICODE', 'VERBOSE', 'X', '_MAXCACHE', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', '__version__', '_alphanum_bytes', '_alphanum_str', '_cache', '_compile', '_compile_repl', '_expand', '_locale', '_pattern_type', '_pickle', '_subx', 'compile', 'copyreg', 'enum', 'error', 'escape', 'findall', 'finditer', 'fullmatch', 'functools', 'match', 'purge', 'search', 'split', 'sre_compile', 'sre_parse', 'sub', 'subn', 'template']\n>>>\n\nYou can also get a small amount of documentation on a particular method using the dir command.\n>>> import re\n>>> help(re.search)\n\nThe built-in documentation is not very extensive, but it can be helpful when you are in a hurry or don't have access to a web browser or search engine.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:\n$ python grep.py\nEnter a regular expression: ^Author\nmbox.txt had 1798 lines that matched ^Author\n\n$ python grep.py\nEnter a regular expression: ^X-\nmbox.txt had 14368 lines that matched ^X-\n\n$ python grep.py\nEnter a regular expression: java$\nmbox.txt had 4218 lines that matched java$\n\nExercise 2: Write a program to look for lines of the form\n`New Revision: 39772`\n\nand extract the number from each of the lines using a regular expression and the findall() method.

Then we will read through the web page data and parse it.\nHyperText Transport Protocol - HTTP \nThe network protocol that powers the web is actually quite simple and there is built-in support in Python called sockets which makes it very easy to make network connections and retrieve data over those sockets in a Python program.\nA socket is much like a file, except that a single socket provides a two-way connection between two programs. You can both read from and write to the same socket. If you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.\nBut if you try to read a socket when the program on the other end of the socket has not sent any data, you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends of the socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will wait for a very long time.\nSo an important part of programs that communicate over the Internet is to have some sort of protocol. A protocol is a set of precise rules that determine who is to go first, what they are to do, and then what the responses are to that message, and who sends next, and so on. In a sense the two applications at either end of the socket are doing a dance and making sure not to step on each other's toes.\nThere are many documents which describe these network protocols. The HyperText Transport Protocol is described in the following document:\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt\nThis is a long and complex 176-page document with a lot of detail. If you find it interesting, feel free to read it all. But if you take a look around page 36 of RFC2616 you will find the syntax for the GET request. To request a document from a web server, we make a connection to the www.pr4e.org server on port 80, and then send a line of the form\nGET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\nwhere the second parameter is the web page we are requesting, and then we also send a blank line. The web server will respond with some header information about the document and a blank line followed by the document content.\nThe World's Simplest Web Browser \nPerhaps the easiest way to show how the HTTP protocol works is to write a very simple Python program that makes a connection to a web server and follows the rules of the HTTP protocol to requests a document and display what the server sends back.\n\n\nFirst the program makes a connection to port 80 on the server www.py4e.com. Since our program is playing the role of the \"web browser\", the HTTP protocol says we must send the GET command followed by a blank line.\nImagen - A Socket Connection\nOnce we send that blank line, we write a loop that receives data in 512-character chunks from the socket and prints the data out until there is no more data to read (i.e., the recv() returns an empty string).\nThe program produces the following output:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 14 Mar 2010 23:52:41 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Tue, 29 Dec 2009 01:31:22 GMT\nETag: \"143c1b33-a7-4b395bea\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 167\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nBut soft what light through yonder window breaks\nIt is the east and Juliet is the sun\nArise fair sun and kill the envious moon\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\n\nThe output starts with headers which the web server sends to describe the document. For example, the Content-Type header indicates that the document is a plain text document (text/plain).\nAfter the server sends us the headers, it adds a blank line to indicate the end of the headers, and then sends the actual data of the file romeo.txt.\nThis example shows how to make a low-level network connection with sockets. Sockets can be used to communicate with a web server or with a mail server or many other kinds of servers. All that is needed is to find the document which describes the protocol and write the code to send and receive the data according to the protocol.\nHowever, since the protocol that we use most commonly is the HTTP web protocol, Python has a special library specifically designed to support the HTTP protocol for the retrieval of documents and data over the web.\nRetrieving an image over HTTP \nIn the above example, we retrieved a plain text file which had newlines in the file and we simply copied the data to the screen as the program ran. We can use a similar program to retrieve an image across using HTTP. Instead of copying the data to the screen as the program runs, we accumulate the data in a string, trim off the headers, and then save the image data to a file as follows:\n\n\nWhen the program runs it produces the following output:\n$ python urljpeg.py\n2920 2920\n1460 4380\n1460 5840\n1460 7300\n...\n1460 62780\n1460 64240\n2920 67160\n1460 68620\n1681 70301\nHeader length 240\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sat, 02 Nov 2013 02:15:07 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Sat, 02 Nov 2013 02:01:26 GMT\nETag: \"19c141-111a9-4ea280f8354b8\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 70057\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\n\nYou can see that for this url, the Content-Type header indicates that body of the document is an image (image/jpeg). Once the program completes, you can view the image data by opening the file stuff.jpg in an image viewer.\nAs the program runs, you can see that we don't get 5120 characters each time we call the recv() method. We get as many characters as have been transferred across the network to us by the web server at the moment we call recv(). In this example, we either get 1460 or 2920 characters each time we request up to 5120 characters of data.\nYour results may be different depending on your network speed. Also note that on the last call to recv() we get 1681 bytes, which is the end of the stream, and in the next call to recv() we get a zero-length string that tells us that the server has called close() on its end of the socket and there is no more data forthcoming.\nWe can slow down our successive recv() calls by uncommenting the call to time.sleep(). This way, we wait a quarter of a second after each call so that the server can \"get ahead\" of us and send more data to us before we call recv() again. With the delay, in place the program executes as follows:\n$ python urljpeg.py\n1460 1460\n5120 6580\n5120 11700\n...\n5120 62900\n5120 68020\n2281 70301\nHeader length 240\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sat, 02 Nov 2013 02:22:04 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Sat, 02 Nov 2013 02:01:26 GMT\nETag: \"19c141-111a9-4ea280f8354b8\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 70057\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\n\nNow other than the first and last calls to recv(), we now get 5120 characters each time we ask for new data.\nThere is a buffer between the server making send() requests and our application making recv() requests. When we run the program with the delay in place, at some point the server might fill up the buffer in the socket and be forced to pause until our program starts to empty the buffer. The pausing of either the sending application or the receiving application is called \"flow control\".\nRetrieving web pages with urllib \nWhile we can manually send and receive data over HTTP using the socket library, there is a much simpler way to perform this common task in Python by using the urllib library.\nUsing urllib, you can treat a web page much like a file. You simply indicate which web page you would like to retrieve and urllib handles all of the HTTP protocol and header details.\nThe equivalent code to read the romeo.txt file from the web using urllib is as follows:\n\n\nOnce the web page has been opened with urllib.urlopen, we can treat it like a file and read through it using a for loop.\nWhen the program runs, we only see the output of the contents of the file. The headers are still sent, but the urllib code consumes the headers and only returns the data to us.\nBut soft what light through yonder window breaks\nIt is the east and Juliet is the sun\nArise fair sun and kill the envious moon\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\n\nAs an example, we can write a program to retrieve the data for romeo.txt and compute the frequency of each word in the file as follows:\n\n\nAgain, once we have opened the web page, we can read it like a local file.\nParsing HTML and scraping the web \nOne of the common uses of the urllib capability in Python is to scrape the web. Web scraping is when we write a program that pretends to be a web browser and retrieves pages, then examines the data in those pages looking for patterns.\nAs an example, a search engine such as Google will look at the source of one web page and extract the links to other pages and retrieve those pages, extracting links, and so on. Using this technique, Google spiders its way through nearly all of the pages on the web.\nGoogle also uses the frequency of links from pages it finds to a particular page as one measure of how \"important\" a page is and how high the page should appear in its search results.\nParsing HTML using regular expressions \nOne simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly search for and extract substrings that match a particular pattern.\nHere is a simple web page:\nThe First Page\n\nIf you like, you can switch to the\n\nSecond Page.\n\n\nWe can construct a well-formed regular expression to match and extract the link values from the above text as follows:\nhref=\"http://.+?\"\n\nOur regular expression looks for strings that start with \"href=\"http://\", followed by one or more characters (\".+?\"), followed by another double quote. The question mark added to the \".+?\" indicates that the match is to be done in a \"non-greedy\" fashion instead of a \"greedy\" fashion. A non-greedy match tries to find the smallest possible matching string and a greedy match tries to find the largest possible matching string.\nWe add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate which part of our matched string we would like to extract, and produce the following program:\n\n\nThe findall regular expression method will give us a list of all of the strings that match our regular expression, returning only the link text between the double quotes.\nWhen we run the program, we get the following output:\npython urlregex.py\nEnter - http://www.dr-chuck.com/page1.htm\nhttp://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm\n\npython urlregex.py\nEnter - http://www.py4e.com/book.htm\nhttp://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html\nhttp://allendowney.com/\nhttp://www.py4e.com/code\nhttp://www.lib.umich.edu/espresso-book-machine\nhttp://www.py4e.com/py4inf-slides.zip\n\nRegular expressions work very nicely when your HTML is well formatted and predictable. But since there are a lot of \"broken\" HTML pages out there, a solution only using regular expressions might either miss some valid links or end up with bad data.\nThis can be solved by using a robust HTML parsing library.\nParsing HTML using BeautifulSoup \nThere are a number of Python libraries which can help you parse HTML and extract data from the pages. Each of the libraries has its strengths and weaknesses and you can pick one based on your needs.\nAs an example, we will simply parse some HTML input and extract links using the BeautifulSoup library. You can install the BeautifulSoup code by opening a terminal and typing pip install bs4\nEven though HTML looks like XML1 and some pages are carefully constructed to be XML, most HTML is generally broken in ways that cause an XML parser to reject the entire page of HTML as improperly formed. BeautifulSoup tolerates highly flawed HTML and still lets you easily extract the data you need.\nWe will use urllib to read the page and then use BeautifulSoup to extract the href attributes from the anchor (a) tags.\n\n\nThe program prompts for a web address, then opens the web page, reads the data and passes the data to the BeautifulSoup parser, and then retrieves all of the anchor tags and prints out the href attribute for each tag.\nWhen the program runs it looks as follows:\npython urllinks.py\nEnter - http://www.dr-chuck.com/page1.htm\nhttp://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm\n\npython urllinks.py\nEnter - http://www.py4e.com/book.htm\nhttp://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html\nhttp://allendowney.com/\nhttp://www.si502.com/\nhttp://www.lib.umich.edu/espresso-book-machine\nhttp://www.py4e.com/code\nhttp://www.py4e.com/\n\nYou can use BeautifulSoup to pull out various parts of each tag as follows:\n\n\npython urllink2.py\nEnter - http://www.dr-chuck.com/page1.htm\nTAG: \nSecond Page\nURL: http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm\nContent: ['\\nSecond Page']\nAttrs: [('href', 'http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm')]\n\nThese examples only begin to show the power of BeautifulSoup when it comes to parsing HTML.\nReading binary files using urllib \nSometimes you want to retrieve a non-text (or binary) file such as an image or video file. The data in these files is generally not useful to print out, but you can easily make a copy of a URL to a local file on your hard disk using urllib.\nThe pattern is to open the URL and use read to download the entire contents of the document into a string variable (img) then write that information to a local file as follows:\n\n\nThis program reads all of the data in at once across the network and stores it in the variable img in the main memory of your computer, then opens the file cover.jpg and writes the data out to your disk. This will work if the size of the file is less than the size of the memory of your computer.\nHowever if this is a large audio or video file, this program may crash or at least run extremely slowly when your computer runs out of memory. In order to avoid running out of memory, we retrieve the data in blocks (or buffers) and then write each block to your disk before retrieving the next block. This way the program can read any size file without using up all of the memory you have in your computer.\n\n\nIn this example, we read only 100,000 characters at a time and then write those characters to the cover.jpg file before retrieving the next 100,000 characters of data from the web.\nThis program runs as follows:\npython curl2.py\n568248 characters copied.\n\nIf you have a Unix or Macintosh computer, you probably have a command built in to your operating system that performs this operation as follows:\ncurl -O http://www.py4e.com/cover.jpg\n\nThe command curl is short for \"copy URL\" and so these two examples are cleverly named curl1.py and curl2.py on www.py4e.com/code3 as they implement similar functionality to the curl command. There is also a curl3.py sample program that does this task a little more effectively, in case you actually want to use this pattern in a program you are writing.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Change the socket program socket1.py to prompt the user for the URL so it can read any web page. You can use split('/') to break the URL into its component parts so you can extract the host name for the socket connect call. Add error checking using try and except to handle the condition where the user enters an improperly formatted or non-existent URL.\nExercise 2: Change your socket program so that it counts the number of characters it has received and stops displaying any text after it has shown 3000 characters. The program should retrieve the entire document and count the total number of characters and display the count of the number of characters at the end of the document.\nExercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. Don't worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.\nExercise 4: Change the urllinks.py program to extract and count paragraph (p) tags from the retrieved HTML document and display the count of the paragraphs as the output of your program. Do not display the paragraph text, only count them. Test your program on several small web pages as well as some larger web pages.\nExercise 5: (Advanced) Change the socket program so that it only shows data after the headers and a blank line have been received. Remember that recv is receiving characters (newlines and all), not lines.\n\n\n1. The XML format is described in the next chapter. ↩\n\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

Python and Web Services","keywords":"","body":"Using Web Services \nOnce it became easy to retrieve documents and parse documents over HTTP using programs, it did not take long to develop an approach where we\nstarted producing documents that were specifically designed to be consumed by other programs (i.e., not HTML to be displayed in a browser).\nThere are two common formats that we use when exchanging data across the web. The \"eXtensible Markup Language\" or XML has been in use for a very long time and is best suited for exchanging document-style data. When programs just want to exchange dictionaries, lists, or other internal information with each other, they use JavaScript Object Notation or JSON (see www.json.org). We will look at both formats.\neXtensible Markup Language - XML \nXML looks very similar to HTML, but XML is more structured than HTML. Here is a sample of an XML document:\n\n  Chuck\n  \n     +1 734 303 4456\n   \n   \n\n\nOften it is helpful to think of an XML document as a tree structure where there is a top tag person and other tags such as phone are drawn as children of their parent nodes.\nImagen - A Tree Representation of XML\nParsing XML \nHere is a simple application that parses some XML and extracts some data elements from the XML:\n\n\nCalling fromstring converts the string representation of the XML into a \"tree\" of XML nodes. When the XML is in a tree, we have a series of methods we can call to extract portions of data from the XML.\nThe find function searches through the XML tree and retrieves a node that matches the specified tag. Each node can have some text, some attributes (like hide), and some \"child\" nodes. Each node can be the top of a tree of nodes.\nName: Chuck\nAttr: yes\n\nUsing an XML parser such as ElementTree has the advantage that while the XML in this example is quite simple, it turns out there are many rules regarding valid XML and using ElementTree allows us to extract data from XML without worrying about the rules of XML syntax.\nLooping through nodes \nOften the XML has multiple nodes and we need to write a loop to process all of the nodes. In the following program, we loop through all of the user nodes:\n\n\nThe findall method retrieves a Python list of subtrees that represent the user structures in the XML tree. Then we can write a for loop that looks at each of the user nodes, and prints the name and id text elements as well as the x attribute from the user node.\nUser count: 2\nName Chuck\nId 001\nAttribute 2\nName Brent\nId 009\nAttribute 7\n\nJavaScript Object Notation - JSON \nThe JSON format was inspired by the object and array format used in the JavaScript language. But since Python was invented before JavaScript, Python's syntax for dictionaries and lists influenced the syntax of JSON. So the format of JSON is nearly identical to a combination of Python lists and dictionaries.\nHere is a JSON encoding that is roughly equivalent to the simple XML from above:\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Chuck\",\n  \"phone\" : {\n    \"type\" : \"intl\",\n    \"number\" : \"+1 734 303 4456\"\n   },\n   \"email\" : {\n     \"hide\" : \"yes\"\n   }\n}\n\nYou will notice some differences. First, in XML, we can add attributes like \"intl\" to the \"phone\" tag. In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. Also the XML \"person\" tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.\nIn general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer capabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it maps directly to some combination of dictionaries and lists. And since nearly all programming languages have something equivalent to Python's dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very natural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data.\nJSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML.\nParsing JSON \nWe construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries (objects) and lists as needed. In this example, we represent a list of users where each user is a set of key-value pairs (i.e., a dictionary). So we have a list of dictionaries.\nIn the following program, we use the built-in json library to parse the JSON and read through the data. Compare this closely to the equivalent XML data and code above. The JSON has less detail, so we must know in advance that we are getting a list and that the list is of users and each user is a set of key-value pairs. The JSON is more succinct (an advantage) but also is less self-describing (a disadvantage).\n\n\nIf you compare the code to extract data from the parsed JSON and XML you will see that what we get from json.loads() is a Python list which we traverse with a for loop, and each item within that list is a Python dictionary. Once the JSON has been parsed, we can use the Python index operator to extract the various bits of data for each user. We don't have to use the JSON library to dig through the parsed JSON, since the returned data is simply native Python structures.\nThe output of this program is exactly the same as the XML version above.\nUser count: 2\nName Chuck\nId 001\nAttribute 2\nName Brent\nId 009\nAttribute 7\n\nIn general, there is an industry trend away from XML and towards JSON for web services. Because the JSON is simpler and more directly maps to native data structures we already have in programming languages, the parsing and data extraction code is usually simpler and more direct when using JSON. But XML is more self-descriptive than JSON and so there are some applications where XML retains an advantage. For example, most word processors store documents internally using XML rather than JSON.\nApplication Programming Interfaces \nWe now have the ability to exchange data between applications using HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and a way to represent complex data that we are sending back and forth between these applications using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\nThe next step is to begin to define and document \"contracts\" between applications using these techniques. The general name for these application-to-application contracts is Application Program Interfaces or APIs. When we use an API, generally one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and publishes the APIs (i.e., the \"rules\") that must be followed to access the services provided by the program.\nWhen we begin to build our programs where the functionality of our program includes access to services provided by other programs, we call the approach a Service-Oriented Architecture or SOA. A SOA approach is one where our overall application makes use of the services of other applications. A non-SOA approach is where the application is a single standalone application which contains all of the code necessary to implement the application.\nWe see many examples of SOA when we use the web. We can go to a single web site and book air travel, hotels, and automobiles all from a single site. The data for hotels is not stored on the airline computers. Instead, the airline computers contact the services on the hotel computers and retrieve the hotel data and present it to the user. When the user agrees to make a hotel reservation using the airline site, the airline site uses another web service on the hotel systems to actually make the reservation. And when it comes time to charge your credit card for the whole transaction, still other computers become involved in the process.\nService Oriented Architecture\nA Service-Oriented Architecture has many advantages including: (1) we always maintain only one copy of data (this is particularly important for things like hotel reservations where we do not want to over-commit) and (2) the owners of the data can set the rules about the use of their data. With these advantages, an SOA system must be carefully designed to have good performance and meet the user's needs.\nWhen an application makes a set of services in its API available over the web, we call these web services.\nSecurity and API usage \nIt is quite common that you need some kind of \"API key\" to make use of a vendor's API. The general idea is that they want to know who is using their services and how much each user is using. Perhaps they have free and pay tiers of their services or have a policy that limits the number of requests that a single individual can make during a particular time period.\nSometimes once you get your API key, you simply include the key as part of POST data or perhaps as a parameter on the URL when calling the API.\nOther times, the vendor wants increased assurance of the source of the requests and so they add expect you to send cryptographically signed messages using shared keys and secrets. A very common technology that is used to sign requests over the Internet is called OAuth. You can read more about the OAuth protocol at www.oauth.net.\nAs the Twitter API became increasingly valuable, Twitter went from an open and public API to an API that required the use of OAuth signatures on each API request. Thankfully there are still a number of convenient and free OAuth libraries so you can avoid writing an OAuth implementation from scratch by reading the specification. These libraries are of varying complexity and have varying degrees of richness. The OAuth web site has information about various OAuth libraries.\nFor this next sample program we will download the files twurl.py, hidden.py, oauth.py, and twitter1.py from www.py4e.com/code and put them all in a folder on your computer.\nTo make use of these programs you will need to have a Twitter account, and authorize your Python code as an application, set up a key, secret, token and token secret. You will edit the file hidden.py and put these four strings into the appropriate variables in the file:\n\n\nThe Twitter web service are accessed using a URL like this:\nhttps://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json\nBut once all of the security information has been added, the URL will look more like:\nhttps://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json?count=2\n&oauth_version=1.0&oauth_token=101...SGI&screen_name=drchuck\n&oauth_nonce=09239679&oauth_timestamp=1380395644\n&oauth_signature=rLK...BoD&oauth_consumer_key=h7Lu...GNg\n&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1\n\nYou can read the OAuth specification if you want to know more about the meaning of the various parameters that are added to meet the security requirements of OAuth.\nFor the programs we run with Twitter, we hide all the complexity in the files oauth.py and twurl.py. We simply set the secrets in hidden.py and then send the desired URL to the twurl.augment() function and the library code adds all the necessary parameters to the URL for us.\nThis program retrieves the timeline for a particular Twitter user and returns it to us in JSON format in a string. We simply print the first 250 characters of the string:\nimport urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\nimport twurl\nimport ssl\n\n# https://apps.twitter.com/\n# Create App and get the four strings, put them in hidden.py\n\nTWITTER_URL = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json'\n\n# Ignore SSL certificate errors\nctx = ssl.create_default_context()\nctx.check_hostname = False\nctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE\n\nwhile True:\n    print('')\n    acct = input('Enter Twitter Account:')\n    if (len(acct) \nWhen the program runs it produces the following output:\nEnter Twitter Account:drchuck\nRetrieving https://api.twitter.com/1.1/ ...\n[{\"created_at\":\"Sat Sep 28 17:30:25 +0000 2013\",\"\nid\":384007200990982144,\"id_str\":\"384007200990982144\",\n\"text\":\"RT @fixpert: See how the Dutch handle traffic\nintersections: http:\\/\\/t.co\\/tIiVWtEhj4\\n#brilliant\",\n\"source\":\"web\",\"truncated\":false,\"in_rep\nRemaining 178\n\nEnter Twitter Account:fixpert\nRetrieving https://api.twitter.com/1.1/ ...\n[{\"created_at\":\"Sat Sep 28 18:03:56 +0000 2013\",\n\"id\":384015634108919808,\"id_str\":\"384015634108919808\",\n\"text\":\"3 months after my freak bocce ball accident,\nmy wedding ring fits again! :)\\n\\nhttps:\\/\\/t.co\\/2XmHPx7kgX\",\n\"source\":\"web\",\"truncated\":false,\nRemaining 177\n\nEnter Twitter Account:\n\nAlong with the returned timeline data, Twitter also returns metadata about the request in the HTTP response headers. One header in particular, x-rate-limit-remaining, informs us how many more requests we can make before we will be shut off for a short time period. You can see that our remaining retrievals drop by one each time we make a request to the API.\nIn the following example, we retrieve a user's Twitter friends, parse the returned JSON, and extract some of the information about the friends. We also dump the JSON after parsing and \"pretty-print\" it with an indent of four characters to allow us to pore through the data when we want to extract more fields.\n\n\nSince the JSON becomes a set of nested Python lists and dictionaries, we can use a combination of the index operation and for loops to wander through the returned data structures with very little Python code.\nThe output of the program looks as follows (some of the data items are shortened to fit on the page):\nEnter Twitter Account:drchuck\nRetrieving https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nRemaining 14\n\n{\n    \"next_cursor\": 1444171224491980205,\n    \"users\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 662433,\n            \"followers_count\": 28725,\n            \"status\": {\n                \"text\": \"@jazzychad I just bought one .__.\",\n                \"created_at\": \"Fri Sep 20 08:36:34 +0000 2013\",\n                \"retweeted\": false,\n            },\n            \"location\": \"San Francisco, California\",\n            \"screen_name\": \"leahculver\",\n            \"name\": \"Leah Culver\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 40426722,\n            \"followers_count\": 2635,\n            \"status\": {\n                \"text\": \"RT @WSJ: Big employers like Google ...\",\n                \"created_at\": \"Sat Sep 28 19:36:37 +0000 2013\",\n            },\n            \"location\": \"Victoria Canada\",\n            \"screen_name\": \"_valeriei\",\n            \"name\": \"Valerie Irvine\",\n    ],\n    \"next_cursor_str\": \"1444171224491980205\"\n}\n\nleahculver\n   @jazzychad I just bought one .__.\n_valeriei\n   RT @WSJ: Big employers like Google, AT&amp;amp;T are h\nericbollens\n   RT @lukew: sneak peek: my LONG take on the good &amp;a\nhalherzog\n   Learning Objects is 10. We had a cake with the LO,\nscweeker\n   @DeviceLabDC love it! Now where so I get that \"etc\n\nEnter Twitter Account:\n\nThe last bit of the output is where we see the for loop reading the five most recent \"friends\" of the drchuck Twitter account and printing the most recent status for each friend. There is a great deal more data available in the returned JSON. If you look in the output of the program, you can also see that the \"find the friends\" of a particular account has a different rate limitation than the number of timeline queries we are allowed to run per time period.\nThese secure API keys allow Twitter to have solid confidence that they know who is using their API and data and at what level. The rate-limiting approach allows us to do simple, personal data retrievals but does not allow us to build a product that pulls data from their API millions of times per day.\nExercises \nExercise 1: Change either the www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py or www.py4e.com/code3/geoxml.py to print out the two-character country code from the retrieved data. Add error checking so your program does not traceback if the country code is not there. Once you have it working, search for \"Atlantic Ocean\" and make sure it can handle locations that are not in any country.\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.

There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are \"not so elegant\" and other programs that are \"more elegant\". Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of \"art\" and \"aesthetic\" to writing code.\nAs programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. If you are working on a million line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. So we need ways to break the program into multiple smaller pieces so to solve a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature we have less to look at.\nIn a way, object oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 500 lines of the code, and understand it while ignoring the other 999,500 lines of code for the moment.\nGetting Started \nLike many aspects of programming it is necessary to learn the concepts of object oriented programming before you can use them effectively. So approach this chapter as a way to learn some terms and concepts and work through a few simple examples to lay a foundation for future learning. Throughout the rest of the book we will be using objects in many of the programs but we won't be building our own new objects in the programs.\nThe key outcome of this chapter is to have a basic understanding of how objects are constructed and how they function and most importantly how we make use of the capabilities of objects that are provided to us by Python and Python libraries.\nUsing Objects \nIt turns out we have been using objects all along in this class. Python provides us with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the first few lines should feel very simple and natural to you.\n\n\nBut instead of focusing on what these lines accomplish, lets look at what is really happening from the point of view of object-oriented programming. Don't worry if the following paragraphs don't make any sense the first time you read them because we have not yet defined all these terms.\nThe first line is constructing an object of type list, the second and third lines are calling the append() method, the fourth line is calling the sort() method, and the fifth line is retrieving the item at position 0.\nThe sixth line is calling the __getitem__() method in the stuff list with a parameter of zero.\nprint (stuff.__getitem__(0))\n\nThe seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th item in the list.\nprint (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))\n\nIn this code, we care calling the __getitem__ method in the list class and passing in the list (stuff) and the item we want retrieved from the list as parameters.\nThe last three lines of the program are completely equivalent, but it is more convenient to simply use the square bracket syntax to look up an item at a particular position in a list.\nWe can take a look into the capabilities of an object by looking at the output of the dir() function:\n>>> stuff = list()\n>>> dir(stuff)\n['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__',\n'__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__',\n'__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__',\n'__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__',\n'__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__',\n'__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__',\n'__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__',\n'__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',\n'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index',\n'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']\n>>>\n\nThe precise definition of dir() is that it lists the methods and attributes of a Python object.\nThe rest of this chapter will define all of the above terms so make sure to come back after you finish the chapter and re-read the above paragraphs to check your understanding.\nStarting with Programs \nA program in its most basic form takes some input, does some processing, and produces some output. Our elevator conversion program demonstrates a very short but complete program showing all three of these steps.\n\n\nIf we think a bit more about this program, there is the \"outside world\" and the program. The input and output aspects are where the program interacts with the outside world. Within the program we have code and data to accomplish the task the program is designed to solve.\nImagen - A program\nWhen we are \"in\" the program, we have some defined interactions with the \"outside\" world, but those interactions are well defined and generally not something we focus on. While we are coding we worry only about the details \"inside the program\".\nOne way to think about object oriented programming is that we are separating our program into multiple \"zones\". Each \"zone\" contains some code and data (like a program) and has well defined interactions with the outside world and the other zones within the program.\nIf we look back at the link extraction application where we used the BeautifulSoup library, we can see a program that is constructed by connecting different objects together to accomplish a task:\n\n\nWe read the URL into a string, and then pass that into urllib to retrieve the data from the web. The urllib library uses the socket library to make the actual network connection to retrieve the data. We take the string that we get back from urllib and hand it to BeautifulSoup for parsing. BeautifulSoup makes use of another object called html.parser1 and returns an object. We call the tags() method in the returned object and then get a dictionary of tag objects, and loop through the tags and call the get() method for each tag to print out the 'href' attribute.\nImagen - A Program as Network of Objects\nWe can draw a picture of this program and how the objects work together.\nThe key here is not to fully understand how this program works but to see how we build a network of interacting objects and orchestrate the movement of information between the objects to create a program. It is also important to note that when you looked at that program several chapters back, you could fully understand what was going on in the program without even realizing that the program was \"orchestrating the movement of data between objects\". Back then it was just lines of code that got the job done.\nSubdividing a Problem - Encapsulation \nOne of the advantages of the object oriented approach is that it can hide complexity. For example, while we need to know how to use the urllib and BeautifulSoup code, we do not need to know how those libraries work internally. It allows us to focus on the part of the problem we need to solve and ignore the other parts of the program.\nImagen - Ignoring Detail When Using an Object\nThis ability to focus on a part of a program that we care about and ignore the rest of the program is also helpful to the developers of the objects. For example the programmers developing BeautifulSoup do not need to know or care about how we retrieve our HTML page, what parts we want to read or what we plan to do with the data we extract from the web page.\nImagen - Ignoring Detail When Building an Object\nAnother word we use to capture this idea that we ignore the internal detail of objects we use is \"encapsulation\". This means that we can know how to use an object without knowing how it internally accomplishes what we need done.\nOur First Python Object \nAt its simplest, an object is some code plus data structures that is smaller than a whole program. Defining a function allows us to store a bit of code and give it a name and then later invoke that code using the name of the function.\nAn object can contain a number of functions (which we call \"methods\") as well as data that is used by those functions. We call data items that are part of the object \"attributes\".\nWe use the class keyword to define the data and code that will make up each of the objects. The class keyword includes the name of the class and begins an indented block of code where we include the attributes (data) and methods (code).\n\n\nEach method looks like a function, starting with the def keyword and consisting of an indented block of code. This example has one attribute (x) and one method (party). The methods have a special first parameter that we name by convention self.\nMuch like the def keyword does not cause function code to be executed, the class keyword does not create an object. Instead, the class keyword defines a template indicating what data and code will be contained in each object of type PartyAnimal. The class is like a cookie cutter and the objects created using the class are the cookies2. You don't put frosting on the cookie cutter, you put frosting on the cookies - and you can put different frosting on each cookie.\nImagen - A Class and Two Objects\nIf you continue through the example code, we see the first executable line of code:\nan = PartyAnimal()\n\nThis is where we instruct Python to construct (e.g. create) an object or \"instance of the class named PartyAnimal\". It looks like a function call to the class itself and Python constructs the object with the right data and methods and returns the object which is then assigned to the variable an. In a way this is quite similar to the following line which we have been using all along:\ncounts = dict()\n\nHere we are instructing Python to construct an object using the dict template (already present in Python), return the instance of dictionary and assign it to the variable counts.\nWhen the PartyAnimal class is used to construct an object, the variable an is used to point to that object. We use an to access the code and data for that particular instance of a PartyAnimal object.\nEach Partyanimal object/instance contains within it a variable x and a method/function named party. We call that party method in this line:\nan.party()\n\nWhen the party method is called, the first parameter (which we call by convention self) points to the particular instance of the PartyAnimal object that party is called from within. Within the party method, we see the line:\nself.x = self.x + 1\n\nThis syntax using the 'dot' operator is saying 'the x within self'. So each time party() is called, the internal x value is incremented by 1 and the value is printed out.\nTo help make sense of the difference between a global function and a method within a class/object, the following line is another way to call the party method within the an object:\nPartyAnimal.party(an)\n\nIn this variation, we are accessing the code from within the class and explicitly passing the object pointer an in as the first parameter (i.e. self within the method). You can think of an.party() as shorthand for the above line.\nWhen the program executes, it produces the following output:\nSo far 1\nSo far 2\nSo far 3\nSo far 4\n\nThe object is constructed, and the party method is called four times, both incrementing and printing the value for x within the an object.\nClasses as Types \nAs we have seen, in Python, all variables have a type. And we can use the built-in dir function to examine the capabilities of a variable. We can use type and dir with the classes that we create.\n\n\nWhen this program executes, it produces the following output:\nType \nDir  ['__class__', '__delattr__', ...\n'__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',\n'__weakref__', 'party', 'x']\nType \nType \n\nYou can see that using the class keyword, we have created a new type. From the dir output, you can see both the x integer attribute and the party method are available in the object.\nObject Lifecycle \nIn the previous examples, we are defining a class (template) and using that class to create an instance of that class (object) and then using the instance. When the program finishes, all the variables are discarded. Usually we don't think much about the creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more complex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the object is being constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is being discarded.\nIf we want our object to be aware of these moments of construction and destruction, we add specially named methods to our object:\nWhen this program executes, it produces the following output:\nI am constructed\nSo far 1\nSo far 2\nI am destructed 2\nan contains 42\n\nAs Python is constructing our object, it calls our __init__ method to give us a chance to set up some default or initial values for the object. When Python encounters the line:\nan = 42\n\nIt actually 'thows our object away' so it can reuse the an variable to store the value 42. Just at the moment when our an object is being 'destroyed' our destructor code (__del__) is called. We cannot stop our variable from being destroyed, but we can do any necessary cleanup right before our object no longer exists.\nWhen developing objects, it is quite common to add a constructor to an object to set in initial values in the object, it is relatively rare to need to need a destructor for an object.\nMany Instances \nSo far, we have been defining a class, making a single object, using that object, and then throwing the object away. But the real power in object oriented happens when we make many instances of our class.\nWhen we are making multiple objects from our class, we might want to set up different initial values for each of the objects. We can pass data into the constructors to give each object a different initial value:\n\n\nThe constructor has both a self parameter that points to the object instance and then additional parameters that are passed into the constructor as the object is being constructed:\ns = PartyAnimal('Sally')\n\nWithin the constructor, the line:\nself.name = nam\n\nCopies the parameter that is passed in (nam) into the name attribute within the object instance.\nThe output of the program shows that each of the objects (s and j) contain their own independent copies of x and nam:\nSally constructed\nSally party count 1\nJim constructed\nJim party count 1\nSally party count 2\n\nInheritance \nAnother powerful feature of object oriented programming is the ability to create a new class by extending an existing class. When extending a class, we call the original class the 'parent class' and the new class as the 'child class'.\nFor this example, we will move our PartyAnimal class into its own file:\n\n\nThen, we can 'import' the PartyAnimal class in a new file and extend it as follows:\n\n\nWhen we are defining the CricketFan object, we indicate that we are extending the PartyAnimal class. This means that all of the variables (x) and methods (party) from the PartyAnimal class are inherited by the CricketFan class.\nYou can see that within the six method in the CricketFan class, we can call the party method from the PartyAnimal class. The variables and methods from the parent class are merged into the child class.\nAs the program executes, we can see that the s and j are independent instances of PartyAnimal and CricketFan. The j object has additional capabilities beyond the s object.\nSally constructed\nSally party count 1\nJim constructed\nJim party count 1\nJim party count 2\nJim points 6\n['__class__', '__delattr__', ... '__weakref__',\n'name', 'party', 'points', 'six', 'x']\n\nIn the dir output for the j object (instance of the CricketFan class) you can see that it both has the attributes and methods of the parent class as well as the attributes and methods that were added when the class was extended to create the CricketFan class.\nSummary \nThis is a very quick introduction to object-oriented programming that focuses mainly on terminology and the syntax of defining and using objects. Let's quickly review the code that we looked at in the beginning of the chapter. At this point you should fully understand what is going on.\n\n\nThe first line constructs a list object. When Python creates the list object, it calls the constructor method (named __init__) to set up the internal data attributes that will be used to store the list data. Due to encapsulation we neither need to know, nor need to care about these in internal data attributes are arranged.\nWe are not passing any parameters to the constructor and when the constructor returns, we use the variable stuff to point to the returned instance of the list class.\nThe second and third lines are calling the append method with one parameter to add a new item at the end of the list by updating the attributes within stuff. Then in the fourth line, we call the sort method with no parameters to sort the data within the stuff object.\nThen we print out the first item in the list using the square brackets which are a shortcut to calling the __getitem__ method within the stuff object. And this is equivalent to calling the __getitem__ method in the list class passing the stuff object in as the first parameter and the position we are looking for as the second parameter.\nAt the end of the program the stuff object is discarded but not before calling the destructor (named __del__) so the object can clean up any loose ends as necessary.\nThose are the basics and terminology of object oriented programming. There are many additional details as to how to best use object oriented approaches when developing large applications and libraries that are beyond the scope of this chapter.3\n\n\n1. https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html ↩\n\n\n2.

Python and Databases","keywords":"","body":"Using Databases and SQL \nWhat is a database? \nA database is a file that is organized for storing data. Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size of the memory in the computer.\nLike a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data. Database software maintains its performance by building indexes as data is added to the database to allow the computer to jump quickly to a particular entry.\nThere are many different database systems which are used for a wide variety of purposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. We focus on SQLite in this book because it is a very common database and is already built into Python. SQLite is designed to be embedded into other applications to provide database support within the application. For example, the Firefox browser also uses the SQLite database internally as do many other products.\nhttp://sqlite.org/\nSQLite is well suited to some of the data manipulation problems that we see in Informatics such as the Twitter spidering application that we describe in this chapter.\nDatabase concepts \nWhen you first look at a database it looks like a spreadsheet with multiple sheets. The primary data structures in a database are: tables, rows, and columns.\nImagen - Relational databases\nIn technical descriptions of relational databases the concepts of table, row, and column are more formally referred to as relation, tuple, and attribute, respectively. We will use the less formal terms in this chapter.\nDatabase Browser for SQLite \nWhile this chapter will focus on using Python to work with data in SQLite database files, many operations can be done more conveniently using software called the Database Browser for SQLite which is freely available from:\nhttp://sqlitebrowser.org/\nUsing the browser you can easily create tables, insert data, edit data, or run simple SQL queries on the data in the database.\nIn a sense, the database browser is similar to a text editor when working with text files. When you want to do one or very few operations on a text file, you can just open it in a text editor and make the changes you want. When you have many changes that you need to do to a text file, often you will write a simple Python program. You will find the same pattern when working with databases. You will do simple operations in the database manager and more complex operations will be most conveniently done in Python.\nCreating a database table \nDatabases require more defined structure than Python lists or dictionaries1.\nWhen we create a database table we must tell the database in advance the names of each of the columns in the table and the type of data which we are planning to store in each column. When the database software knows the type of data in each column, it can choose the most efficient way to store and look up the data based on the type of data.\nYou can look at the various data types supported by SQLite at the following url:\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html\nDefining structure for your data up front may seem inconvenient at the beginning, but the payoff is fast access to your data even when the database contains a large amount of data.\nThe code to create a database file and a table named Tracks with two columns in the database is as follows:\n\n\nThe connect operation makes a \"connection\" to the database stored in the file music.sqlite3 in the current directory. If the file does not exist, it will be created. The reason this is called a \"connection\" is that sometimes the database is stored on a separate \"database server\" from the server on which we are running our application. In our simple examples the database will just be a local file in the same directory as the Python code we are running.\nA cursor is like a file handle that we can use to perform operations on the data stored in the database. Calling cursor() is very similar conceptually to calling open() when dealing with text files.\nImagen - A Database Cursor\nOnce we have the cursor, we can begin to execute commands on the contents of the database using the execute() method.\nDatabase commands are expressed in a special language that has been standardized across many different database vendors to allow us to learn a single database language. The database language is called Structured Query Language or SQL for short.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\nIn our example, we are executing two SQL commands in our database. As a convention, we will show the SQL keywords in uppercase and the parts of the command that we are adding (such as the table and column names) will be shown in lowercase.\nThe first SQL command removes the Tracks table from the database if it exists. This pattern is simply to allow us to run the same program to create the Tracks table over and over again without causing an error. Note that the DROP TABLE command deletes the table and all of its contents from the database (i.e., there is no \"undo\").\ncur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks ')\n\nThe second command creates a table named Tracks with a text column named title and an integer column named plays.\ncur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')\n\nNow that we have created a table named Tracks, we can put some data into that table using the SQL INSERT operation. Again, we begin by making a connection to the database and obtaining the cursor. We can then execute SQL commands using the cursor.\nThe SQL INSERT command indicates which table we are using and then defines a new row by listing the fields we want to include (title, plays) followed by the VALUES we want placed in the new row. We specify the values as question marks (?, ?) to indicate that the actual values are passed in as a tuple ( 'My Way', 15 ) as the second parameter to the execute() call.\n\n\nFirst we INSERT two rows into our table and use commit() to force the data to be written to the database file.\nImagen - Rows in a Table\nThen we use the SELECT command to retrieve the rows we just inserted from the table. On the SELECT command, we indicate which columns we would like (title, plays) and indicate which table we want to retrieve the data from. After we execute the SELECT statement, the cursor is something we can loop through in a for statement. For efficiency, the cursor does not read all of the data from the database when we execute the SELECT statement. Instead, the data is read on demand as we loop through the rows in the for statement.\nThe output of the program is as follows:\nTracks:\n('Thunderstruck', 20)\n('My Way', 15)\n\nOur for loop finds two rows, and each row is a Python tuple with the first value as the title and the second value as the number of plays.\nNote: You may see strings starting with u' in other books or on the Internet. This was an indication in Python 2 that the strings are Unicode strings that are capable of storing non-Latin character sets. In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings by default.\nAt the very end of the program, we execute an SQL command to DELETE the rows we have just created so we can run the program over and over. The DELETE command shows the use of a WHERE clause that allows us to express a selection criterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only the rows that match the criterion. In this example the criterion happens to apply to all the rows so we empty the table out so we can run the program repeatedly. After the DELETE is performed, we also call commit() to force the data to be removed from the database.\nStructured Query Language summary \nSo far, we have been using the Structured Query Language in our Python examples and have covered many of the basics of the SQL commands. In this section, we look at the SQL language in particular and give an overview of SQL syntax.\nSince there are so many different database vendors, the Structured Query Language (SQL) was standardized so we could communicate in a portable manner to database systems from multiple vendors.\nA relational database is made up of tables, rows, and columns. The columns generally have a type such as text, numeric, or date data. When we create a table, we indicate the names and types of the columns:\nCREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)\n\nTo insert a row into a table, we use the SQL INSERT command:\nINSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES ('My Way', 15)\n\nThe INSERT statement specifies the table name, then a list of the fields/columns that you would like to set in the new row, and then the keyword VALUES and a list of corresponding values for each of the fields.\nThe SQL SELECT command is used to retrieve rows and columns from a database. The SELECT statement lets you specify which columns you would like to retrieve as well as a WHERE clause to select which rows you would like to see. It also allows an optional ORDER BY clause to control the sorting of the returned rows.\nSELECT * FROM Tracks WHERE title = 'My Way'\n\nUsing * indicates that you want the database to return all of the columns for each row that matches the WHERE clause.\nNote, unlike in Python, in a SQL WHERE clause we use a single equal sign to indicate a test for equality rather than a double equal sign. Other logical operations allowed in a WHERE clause include , >, , >=, !=, as well as AND and OR and parentheses to build your logical expressions.\nYou can request that the returned rows be sorted by one of the fields as follows:\nSELECT title,plays FROM Tracks ORDER BY title\n\nTo remove a row, you need a WHERE clause on an SQL DELETE statement. The WHERE clause determines which rows are to be deleted:\nDELETE FROM Tracks WHERE title = 'My Way'\n\nIt is possible to UPDATE a column or columns within one or more rows in a table using the SQL UPDATE statement as follows:\nUPDATE Tracks SET plays = 16 WHERE title = 'My Way'\n\nThe UPDATE statement specifies a table and then a list of fields and values to change after the SET keyword and then an optional WHERE clause to select the rows that are to be updated. A single UPDATE statement will change all of the rows that match the WHERE clause. If a WHERE clause is not specified, it performs the UPDATE on all of the rows in the table.\nThese four basic SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE) allow the four basic operations needed to create and maintain data.\nSpidering Twitter using a database \nIn this section, we will create a simple spidering program that will go through Twitter accounts and build a database of them. Note: Be very careful when running this program. You do not want to pull too much data or run the program for too long and end up having your Twitter access shut off.\nOne of the problems of any kind of spidering program is that it needs to be able to be stopped and restarted many times and you do not want to lose the data that you have retrieved so far. You don't want to always restart your data retrieval at the very beginning so we want to store data as we retrieve it so our program can start back up and pick up where it left off.\nWe will start by retrieving one person's Twitter friends and their statuses, looping through the list of friends, and adding each of the friends to a database to be retrieved in the future. After we process one person's Twitter friends, we check in our database and retrieve one of the friends of the friend. We do this over and over, picking an \"unvisited\" person, retrieving their friend list, and adding friends we have not seen to our list for a future visit.\nWe also track how many times we have seen a particular friend in the database to get some sense of their \"popularity\".\nBy storing our list of known accounts and whether we have retrieved the account or not, and how popular the account is in a database on the disk of the computer, we can stop and restart our program as many times as we like.\nThis program is a bit complex. It is based on the code from the exercise earlier in the book that uses the Twitter API.\nHere is the source code for our Twitter spidering application:\n\n\nOur database is stored in the file spider.sqlite3 and it has one table named Twitter. Each row in the Twitter table has a column for the account name, whether we have retrieved the friends of this account, and how many times this account has been \"friended\".\nIn the main loop of the program, we prompt the user for a Twitter account name or \"quit\" to exit the program. If the user enters a Twitter account, we retrieve the list of friends and statuses for that user and add each friend to the database if not already in the database. If the friend is already in the list, we add 1 to the friends field in the row in the database.\nIf the user presses enter, we look in the database for the next Twitter account that we have not yet retrieved, retrieve the friends and statuses for that account, add them to the database or update them, and increase their friends count.\nOnce we retrieve the list of friends and statuses, we loop through all of the user items in the returned JSON and retrieve the screen_name for each user. Then we use the SELECT statement to see if we already have stored this particular screen_name in the database and retrieve the friend count (friends) if the record exists.\ncountnew = 0\ncountold = 0\nfor u in js['users'] :\n    friend = u['screen_name']\n    print friend\n    cur.execute('SELECT friends FROM Twitter WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',\n        (friend, ) )\n    try:\n        count = cur.fetchone()[0]\n        cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET friends = ? WHERE name = ?',\n            (count+1, friend) )\n        countold = countold + 1\n    except:\n        cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Twitter (name, retrieved, friends)\n            VALUES ( ?, 0, 1 )''', ( friend, ) )\n        countnew = countnew + 1\nprint 'New accounts=',countnew,' revisited=',countold\nconn.commit()\n\nOnce the cursor executes the SELECT statement, we must retrieve the rows. We could do this with a for statement, but since we are only retrieving one row (LIMIT 1), we can use the fetchone() method to fetch the first (and only) row that is the result of the SELECT operation. Since fetchone() returns the row as a tuple (even though there is only one field), we take the first value from the tuple to get the current friend count into the variable count.\nIf this retrieval is successful, we use the SQL UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause to add 1 to the friends column for the row that matches the friend's account. Notice that there are two placeholders (i.e., question marks) in the SQL, and the second parameter to the execute() is a two-element tuple that holds the values to be substituted into the SQL in place of the question marks.\nIf the code in the try block fails, it is probably because no record matched the WHERE name = ? clause on the SELECT statement. So in the except block, we use the SQL INSERT statement to add the friend's screen_name to the table with an indication that we have not yet retrieved the screen_name and set the friend count to zero.\nSo the first time the program runs and we enter a Twitter account, the program runs as follows:\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit: drchuck\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 20  revisited= 0\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit: quit\n\nSince this is the first time we have run the program, the database is empty and we create the database in the file spider.sqlite3 and add a table named Twitter to the database. Then we retrieve some friends and add them all to the database since the database is empty.\nAt this point, we might want to write a simple database dumper to take a look at what is in our spider.sqlite3 file:\n\n\nThis program simply opens the database and selects all of the columns of all of the rows in the table Twitter, then loops through the rows and prints out each row.\nIf we run this program after the first execution of our Twitter spider above, its output will be as follows:\n('opencontent', 0, 1)\n('lhawthorn', 0, 1)\n('steve_coppin', 0, 1)\n('davidkocher', 0, 1)\n('hrheingold', 0, 1)\n...\n20 rows.\n\nWe see one row for each screen_name, that we have not retrieved the data for that screen_name, and everyone in the database has one friend.\nNow our database reflects the retrieval of the friends of our first Twitter account (drchuck). We can run the program again and tell it to retrieve the friends of the next \"unprocessed\" account by simply pressing enter instead of a Twitter account as follows:\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit:\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 18  revisited= 2\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit:\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 17  revisited= 3\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit: quit\n\nSince we pressed enter (i.e., we did not specify a Twitter account), the following code is executed:\nif ( len(acct) \nWe use the SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the name of the first (LIMIT 1) user who still has their \"have we retrieved this user\" value set to zero. We also use the fetchone()[0] pattern within a try/except block to either extract a screen_name from the retrieved data or put out an error message and loop back up.\nIf we successfully retrieved an unprocessed screen_name, we retrieve their data as follows:\nurl = twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL, {'screen_name': acct, 'count': '20'})\nprint('Retrieving')\nurl connection = urllib.urlopen(url)\ndata = connection.read()\njs = json.loads(data)\ncur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET retrieved = 1 WHERE nombre =?', (acct,))\n\nOnce we retrieve the data successfully, we use the UPDATE statement to set the retrieved column to 1 to indicate that we have completed the retrieval of the friends of this account. This keeps us from retrieving the same data over and over and keeps us progressing forward through the network of Twitter friends.\nIf we run the friend program and press enter twice to retrieve the next unvisited friend's friends, then run the dumping program, it will give us the following output:\n('opencontent', 1, 1)\n('lhawthorn', 1, 1)\n('steve_coppin', 0, 1)\n('davidkocher', 0, 1)\n('hrheingold', 0, 1)\n...\n('cnxorg', 0, 2)\n('knoop', 0, 1)\n('kthanos', 0, 2)\n('LectureTools', 0, 1)\n...\n55 rows.\n\nWe can see that we have properly recorded that we have visited lhawthorn and opencontent. Also the accounts cnxorg and kthanos already have two followers. Since we now have retrieved the friends of three people (drchuck, opencontent, and lhawthorn) our table has 55 rows of friends to retrieve.\nEach time we run the program and press enter it will pick the next unvisited account (e.g., the next account will be steve_coppin), retrieve their friends, mark them as retrieved, and for each of the friends of steve_coppin either add them to the end of the database or update their friend count if they are already in the database.\nSince the program's data is all stored on disk in a database, the spidering activity can be suspended and resumed as many times as you like with no loss of data.\nBasic data modeling \nThe real power of a relational database is when we create multiple tables and make links between those tables. The act of deciding how to break up your application data into multiple tables and establishing the relationships between the tables is called data modeling. The design document that shows the tables and their relationships is called a data model.\nData modeling is a relatively sophisticated skill and we will only introduce the most basic concepts of relational data modeling in this section. For more detail on data modeling you can start with:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model\nLet's say for our Twitter spider application, instead of just counting a person's friends, we wanted to keep a list of all of the incoming relationships so we could find a list of everyone who is following a particular account.\nSince everyone will potentially have many accounts that follow them, we cannot simply add a single column to our Twitter table. So we create a new table that keeps track of pairs of friends. The following is a simple way of making such a table:\nCREATE TABLE Pals (from_friend TEXT, to_friend TEXT)\n\nEach time we encounter a person who drchuck is following, we would insert a row of the form:\nINSERT INTO Pals (from_friend,to_friend) VALUES ('drchuck', 'lhawthorn')\n\nAs we are processing the 20 friends from the drchuck Twitter feed, we will insert 20 records with \"drchuck\" as the first parameter so we will end up duplicating the string many times in the database.\nThis duplication of string data violates one of the best practices for database normalization which basically states that we should never put the same string data in the database more than once. If we need the data more than once, we create a numeric key for the data and reference the actual data using this key.\nIn practical terms, a string takes up a lot more space than an integer on the disk and in the memory of our computer, and takes more processor time to compare and sort. If we only have a few hundred entries, the storage and processor time hardly matters. But if we have a million people in our database and a possibility of 100 million friend links, it is important to be able to scan data as quickly as possible.\nWe will store our Twitter accounts in a table named People instead of the Twitter table used in the previous example. The People table has an additional column to store the numeric key associated with the row for this Twitter user. SQLite has a feature that automatically adds the key value for any row we insert into a table using a special type of data column (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY).\nWe can create the People table with this additional id column as follows:\nCREATE TABLE People\n    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)\n\nNotice that we are no longer maintaining a friend count in each row of the People table. When we select INTEGER PRIMARY KEY as the type of our id column, we are indicating that we would like SQLite to manage this column and assign a unique numeric key to each row we insert automatically. We also add the keyword UNIQUE to indicate that we will not allow SQLite to insert two rows with the same value for name.\nNow instead of creating the table Pals above, we create a table called Follows with two integer columns from_id and to_id and a constraint on the table that the combination of from_id and to_id must be unique in this table (i.e., we cannot insert duplicate rows) in our database.\nCREATE TABLE Follows\n    (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id) )\n\nWhen we add UNIQUE clauses to our tables, we are communicating a set of rules that we are asking the database to enforce when we attempt to insert records. We are creating these rules as a convenience in our programs, as we will see in a moment. The rules both keep us from making mistakes and make it simpler to write some of our code.\nIn essence, in creating this Follows table, we are modelling a \"relationship\" where one person \"follows\" someone else and representing it with a pair of numbers indicating that (a) the people are connected and (b) the direction of the relationship.\nImagen - Relationships Between Tables\nProgramming with multiple tables \nWe will now redo the Twitter spider program using two tables, the primary keys, and the key references as described above. Here is the code for the new version of the program:\n\n\nThis program is starting to get a bit complicated, but it illustrates the patterns that we need to use when we are using integer keys to link tables. The basic patterns are:\n\nCreate tables with primary keys and constraints.\nWhen we have a logical key for a person (i.e., account name) and we need the id value for the person, depending on whether or not the person is already in the People table we either need to: (1) look up the person in the People table and retrieve the id value for the person or (2) add the person to the People table and get the id value for the newly added row.\nInsert the row that captures the \"follows\" relationship.\n\nWe will cover each of these in turn.\nConstraints in database tables \nAs we design our table structures, we can tell the database system that we would like it to enforce a few rules on us. These rules help us from making mistakes and introducing incorrect data into out tables. When we create our tables:\ncur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People\n    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)''')\ncur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Follows\n    (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id))''')\n\nWe indicate that the name column in the People table must be UNIQUE. We also indicate that the combination of the two numbers in each row of the Follows table must be unique. These constraints keep us from making mistakes such as adding the same relationship more than once.\nWe can take advantage of these constraints in the following code:\ncur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved)\n    VALUES ( ?, 0)''', ( friend, ) )\n\nWe add the OR IGNORE clause to our INSERT statement to indicate that if this particular INSERT would cause a violation of the \"name must be unique\" rule, the database system is allowed to ignore the INSERT. We are using the database constraint as a safety net to make sure we don't inadvertently do something incorrect.\nSimilarly, the following code ensures that we don't add the exact same Follows relationship twice.\ncur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows\n    (from_id, to_id) VALUES (?, ?)''', (id, friend_id) )\n\nAgain, we simply tell the database to ignore our attempted INSERT if it would violate the uniqueness constraint that we specified for the Follows rows.\nRetrieve and/or insert a record \nWhen we prompt the user for a Twitter account, if the account exists, we must look up its id value. If the account does not yet exist in the People table, we must insert the record and get the id value from the inserted row.\nThis is a very common pattern and is done twice in the program above. This code shows how we look up the id for a friend's account when we have extracted a screen_name from a user node in the retrieved Twitter JSON.\nSince over time it will be increasingly likely that the account will already be in the database, we first check to see if the People record exists using a SELECT statement.\nIf all goes well2 inside the try section, we retrieve the record using fetchone() and then retrieve the first (and only) element of the returned tuple and store it in friend_id.\nIf the SELECT fails, the fetchone()[0] code will fail and control will transfer into the except section.\n    friend = u['screen_name']\n    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM People WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',\n        (friend, ) )\n    try:\n        friend_id = cur.fetchone()[0]\n        countold = countold + 1\n    except:\n        cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved)\n            VALUES ( ?, 0)''', ( friend, ) )\n        conn.commit()\n        if cur.rowcount != 1 :\n            print 'Error inserting account:',friend\n            continue\n        friend_id = cur.lastrowid\n        countnew = countnew + 1\n\nIf we end up in the except code, it simply means that the row was not found, so we must insert the row. We use INSERT OR IGNORE just to avoid errors and then call commit() to force the database to really be updated. After the write is done, we can check the cur.rowcount to see how many rows were affected. Since we are attempting to insert a single row, if the number of affected rows is something other than 1, it is an error.\nIf the INSERT is successful, we can look at cur.lastrowid to find out what value the database assigned to the id column in our newly created row.\nStoring the friend relationship \nOnce we know the key value for both the Twitter user and the friend in the JSON, it is a simple matter to insert the two numbers into the Follows table with the following code:\ncur.execute('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows (from_id, to_id) VALUES (?, ?)',\n    (id, friend_id) )\n\nNotice that we let the database take care of keeping us from \"double-inserting\" a relationship by creating the table with a uniqueness constraint and then adding OR IGNORE to our INSERT statement.\nHere is a sample execution of this program:\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit:\nNo unretrieved Twitter accounts found\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit: drchuck\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 20  revisited= 0\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit:\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 17  revisited= 3\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit:\nRetrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...\nNew accounts= 17  revisited= 3\nEnter a Twitter account, or quit: quit\n\nWe started with the drchuck account and then let the program automatically pick the next two accounts to retrieve and add to our database.\nThe following is the first few rows in the People and Follows tables after this run is completed:\nPeople:\n(1, 'drchuck', 1)\n(2, 'opencontent', 1)\n(3, 'lhawthorn', 1)\n(4, 'steve_coppin', 0)\n(5, 'davidkocher', 0)\n55 rows.\nFollows:\n(1, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(1, 6)\n60 rows.\n\nYou can see the id, name, and visited fields in the People table and you see the numbers of both ends of the relationship in the Follows table. In the People table, we can see that the first three people have been visited and their data has been retrieved. The data in the Follows table indicates that drchuck (user 1) is a friend to all of the people shown in the first five rows. This makes sense because the first data we retrieved and stored was the Twitter friends of drchuck. If you were to print more rows from the Follows table, you would see the friends of users 2 and 3 as well.\nThree kinds of keys \nTODO go on here\nNow that we have started building a data model putting our data into multiple linked tables and linking the rows in those tables using keys, we need to look at some terminology around keys. There are generally three kinds of keys used in a database model.\n\nA logical key is a key that the \"real world\" might use to look up a row. In our example data model, the name field is a logical key. It is the screen name for the user and we indeed look up a user's row several times in the program using the name field. You will often find that it makes sense to add a UNIQUE constraint to a logical key. Since the logical key is how we look up a row from the outside world, it makes little sense to allow multiple rows with the same value in the table.\nA primary key is usually a number that is assigned automatically by the database. It generally has no meaning outside the program and is only used to link rows from different tables together. When we want to look up a row in a table, usually searching for the row using the primary key is the fastest way to find the row. Since primary keys are integer numbers, they take up very little storage and can be compared or sorted very quickly. In our data model, the id field is an example of a primary key.\nA foreign key is usually a number that points to the primary key of an associated row in a different table. An example of a foreign key in our data model is the from_id.\n\nWe are using a naming convention of always calling the primary key field name id and appending the suffix _id to any field name that is a foreign key.\nUsing JOIN to retrieve data \nNow that we have followed the rules of database normalization and have data separated into two tables, linked together using primary and foreign keys, we need to be able to build a SELECT that reassembles the data across the tables.\nSQL uses the JOIN clause to reconnect these tables. In the JOIN clause you specify the fields that are used to reconnect the rows between the tables.\nThe following is an example of a SELECT with a JOIN clause:\nSELECT * FROM Follows JOIN People\n    ON Follows.from_id = People.id WHERE People.id = 1\n\nThe JOIN clause indicates that the fields we are selecting cross both the Follows and People tables. The ON clause indicates how the two tables are to be joined: Take the rows from Follows and append the row from People where the field from_id in Follows is the same the id value in the People table.\nImagen - Connecting Tables Using JOIN\nThe result of the JOIN is to create extra-long \"metarows\" which have both the fields from People and the matching fields from Follows. Where there is more than one match between the id field from People and the from_id from People, then JOIN creates a metarow for each of the matching pairs of rows, duplicating data as needed.\nThe following code demonstrates the data that we will have in the database after the multi-table Twitter spider program (above) has been run several times.\n\n\nIn this program, we first dump out the People and Follows and then dump out a subset of the data in the tables joined together.\nHere is the output of the program:\npython twjoin.py\nPeople:\n(1, 'drchuck', 1)\n(2, 'opencontent', 1)\n(3, 'lhawthorn', 1)\n(4, 'steve_coppin', 0)\n(5, 'davidkocher', 0)\n55 rows.\nFollows:\n(1, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(1, 6)\n60 rows.\nConnections for id=2:\n(2, 1, 1, 'drchuck', 1)\n(2, 28, 28, 'cnxorg', 0)\n(2, 30, 30, 'kthanos', 0)\n(2, 102, 102, 'SomethingGirl', 0)\n(2, 103, 103, 'ja_Pac', 0)\n20 rows.\n\nYou see the columns from the People and Follows tables and the last set of rows is the result of the SELECT with the JOIN clause.\nIn the last select, we are looking for accounts that are friends of \"opencontent\" (i.e., People.id=2).\nIn each of the \"metarows\" in the last select, the first two columns are from the Follows table followed by columns three through five from the People table. You can also see that the second column (Follows.to_id) matches the third column (People.id) in each of the joined-up \"metarows\".\nSummary \nThis chapter has covered a lot of ground to give you an overview of the basics of using a database in Python. It is more complicated to write the code to use a database to store data than Python dictionaries or flat files so there is little reason to use a database unless your application truly needs the capabilities of a database. The situations where a database can be quite useful are: (1) when your application needs to make small many random updates within a large data set, (2) when your data is so large it cannot fit in a dictionary and you need to look up information repeatedly, or (3) when you have a long-running process that you want to be able to stop and restart and retain the data from one run to the next.\nYou can build a simple database with a single table to suit many application needs, but most problems will require several tables and links/relationships between rows in different tables. When you start making links between tables, it is important to do some thoughtful design and follow the rules of database normalization to make the best use of the database's capabilities. Since the primary motivation for using a database is that you have a large amount of data to deal with, it is important to model your data efficiently so your programs run as fast as possible.\nDebugging \nOne common pattern when you are developing a Python program to connect to an SQLite database will be to run a Python program and check the results using the Database Browser for SQLite. The browser allows you to quickly check to see if your program is working properly.\nYou must be careful because SQLite takes care to keep two programs from changing the same data at the same time. For example, if you open a database in the browser and make a change to the database and have not yet pressed the \"save\" button in the browser, the browser \"locks\" the database file and keeps any other program from accessing the file. In particular, your Python program will not be able to access the file if it is locked.\nSo a solution is to make sure to either close the database browser or use the File menu to close the database in the browser before you attempt to access the database from Python to avoid the problem of your Python code failing because the database is locked.\n\n\n1. SQLite actually does allow some flexibility in the type of data stored in a column, but we will keep our data types strict in this chapter so the concepts apply equally to other database systems such as MySQL. ↩\n\n\n1.

A format that allows for the markup of structured data based on the syntax of JavaScript Objects.\nSOA\nService-Oriented Architecture. When an application is made of components connected across a network.\nXML\neXtensible Markup Language. A format that allows for the markup of structured data.\nattribute\nA variable that is part of a class.\nclass\nA template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object.\nchild class\nA new class created when a parent class is extended. The child class inherits all of the attributes and methods of the parent class.\nconstructor\nAn optional specially named method (init) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object.\ndestructor\nAn optional specially named method (del) that is called at the moment just before an object is destroyed. Destructors are rarely used.\ninheritance\nWhen we create a new class (child) by extending an existing class (parent). The child class has all the attributes and methods of the parent class plus additional attributes and methods defined by the child class.\nmethod\nA function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use 'message' instead of 'method' to describe this concept.\nobject\nA constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term 'instance' interchangeably with 'object'.\nparent class\nThe class which is being extended to create a new child class. The parent class contributes all of its methods and attributes to the new child class.\nattribute\nOne of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a \"column\" or \"field\".\nconstraint\nWhen we tell the database to enforce a rule on a field or a row in a table. A common constraint is to insist that there can be no duplicate values in a particular field (i.e., all the values must be unique).\ncursor\nA cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network connections and files, respectively.\ndatabase browser\nA piece of software that allows you to directly connect to a database and manipulate the database directly without writing a program.\nforeign key\nA numeric key that points to the primary key of a row in another table. Foreign keys establish relationships between rows stored in different tables.\nindex\nAdditional data that the database software maintains as rows and inserts into a table to make lookups very fast.\nlogical key\nA key that the \"outside world\" uses to look up a particular row. For example in a table of user accounts, a person's email address might be a good candidate as the logical key for the user's data.\nnormalization\nDesigning a data model so that no data is replicated. We store each item of data at one place in the database and reference it elsewhere using a foreign key.\nprimary key\nA numeric key assigned to each row that is used to refer to one row in a table from another table. Often the database is configured to automatically assign primary keys as rows are inserted.\nrelation\nAn area within a database that contains tuples and attributes. More typically called a \"table\".\ntuple\nA single entry in a database table that is a set of attributes. More typically called \"row\".\nPython for person in everybody, escrito a partir del libro 'Python for Everybody' por Charles R.
